# Mobile Vibe Hackathon 2025 - Documentation

**Date:** Monday, December 22, 2025  
**Time:** 9:00 AM - Full Day (8-10 hours)  
**Format:** Hybrid (In-person + Remote)  
**Website:** https://planton.ai/hackathon/mobile-vibe-2025

---

## Overview

This hackathon establishes the mobile app development foundation at Planton Cloud, enabling the team to build mobile apps using Cursor AI (vibe coding) without worrying about tooling, workflow, or deployment decisions.

### The Parallel to 2020

In 2020, Suresh knew zero about building APIs. Swaroop had a 30-minute call explaining all foundational choices (Java, PostgreSQL, gRPC, git workflow, SDLC). By the end, Suresh only had to worry about writing code. That foundation enabled 5 years of productive API development.

**This hackathon is that 30-minute call - but for mobile development.**

---

## Two-Phase Agenda

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (~4 hours)

**Swaroop leads as teacher/decision-maker. Team learns together.**

#### Technical Decisions to Make:

1. **Mobile Platform** - React Native vs Flutter vs Native iOS/Android
2. **Development Environment** - IDE setup, simulators/emulators, required tools
3. **Project Structure** - Monorepo vs separate repos, folder organization
4. **Git Workflow** - Branching strategy, commit conventions, PR process
5. **Build System** - Local builds, hot reload, debugging setup
6. **Deployment** - How to get apps onto devices, app store preparation
7. **State Management** - Which libraries/patterns to use
8. **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, manual testing workflow
9. **Backend Strategy** - Do apps need backends? Local storage vs cloud? (Firebase, Supabase, custom API, etc.)
10. **Common Libraries** - Navigation, UI components, utilities

#### Outcome:
Everyone leaves Phase 1 with a working dev environment and clear understanding of the full SDLC - ready to just write code.

### Phase 2: Execution (~4-6 hours)

**Everyone builds using Cursor AI (vibe coding).**

Apply Phase 1 decisions to build actual apps:

1. **Vehicle Mileage Tracker** (requested by Avinash)
   - Track odometer readings with date/time
   - Automatic mileage calculation
   - Historical trend visualization
   - Simple, clean interface
   - Works on both Android and iOS

2. **Construction Expense Tracker** (requested by Sai)
   - Track construction expenses by partner
   - Record who spent what with receipts/notes
   - See real-time investment totals per partner
   - Calculate profit distribution at project end
   - Replace paper-based expense reconciliation

3. **Personal App Ideas**
   - Bring your own ideas and build them!

#### Outcome:
Real working apps built with AI assistance. Focus exclusively on writing code.

## Roles

- **Swaroop:** Teacher and technical decision-maker (like in 2020)
- **Everyone else:** Students - ask questions, learn, take notes

---

## Expectations

After this hackathon, you should **only worry about writing code for mobile apps**. Everything else will be figured out and documented.

---

## Logistics

- **When:** Monday, December 22, 2025 @ 9:00 AM
- **Where:** Hybrid - in-person at office or remote from home
- **Duration:** Full day (8-10 hours) with flexible breaks
- **RSVP:** Super informal - react on Slack or just show up
- **What to bring:** Laptop, enthusiasm, app ideas

---

## Participants

### Confirmed Core Team:
- Suresh
- Swaroop
- Satish

### Likely Participants:
- Avinash (Product Owner, requested Vehicle Mileage Tracker)
- Sai (requested Construction Expense Tracker)
- Other team members and close friends
