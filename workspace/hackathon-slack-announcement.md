🚀 **MobileVibe Hackathon 2025** 🚀

Hey team! 

I'm excited to announce our first-ever mobile app hackathon at Planton Cloud!

**📅 When:** Monday, December 22nd, 2025  
**⏰ Time:** 9:00 AM (full day - 8-10 hours)  
**📍 Format:** Hybrid (join in-person or remote)

**🎯 Why This Hackathon?**

We've never built mobile apps at Planton Cloud, and it's time to change that! I want to normalize building mobile apps just like we've normalized vibe coding for other things. There are so many small ideas that could become reality if we had a solid mobile workflow established.

**💡 Initial App Ideas (starting points):**

1. **Vehicle Mileage Tracker** - For Avinash, who's been maintaining car meter logs manually. Let's build him an app to track mileage over time with simple data entry and visualization.

2. **Construction Partner Expense Tracker** - For Sai's real estate construction business in Hyderabad. When building apartments with multiple partners, track who invested/spent what during construction, replacing paper-based reconciliation with a simple digital solution for profit sharing.

But these are just starting points! **Bring your own ideas** - any mobile app you've been wanting to build, this is your chance.

**🛠️ What to Bring:**

Nothing! We'll set up development environments together during the hackathon. No prerequisites needed.

**📝 RSVP:**

Super informal - just show up! (But feel free to drop a reaction or comment if you're planning to join so we can get a headcount)

Looking forward to building some awesome mobile apps with all of you! 🎉
