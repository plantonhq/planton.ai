# Slack Message - Mobile Vibe Hackathon 2025

Hey team! 👋

Now that we're getting close to Monday, I wanted to share the agenda and set proper expectations for how the hackathon will flow.

**Quick story for context:**

Back in 2020, I knew zero about building APIs. Swaroop and I had a 30-minute call where he walked me through all the foundational choices - Java, PostgreSQL, gRPC, git workflow, project structure, the whole SDLC. By the end of that call, I had one job left: **write the code**. Everything else was decided. That foundation enabled 5 years of productive API development.

**That's exactly what we're doing Monday with mobile apps.**

We want to build mobile apps. We have Cursor AI to help us write code. But we don't know which platform to use, how to set up dev environments, where to store code, how to build/test/deploy, which libraries to use, or if we even need backends.

**So here's how the day will work:**

**First Half (~4 hours): Foundation Setup**

Swaroop will drive the technical decisions. We'll figure out together:

• Mobile Platform - React Native vs Flutter vs Native iOS/Android
• Dev Environment - IDE setup, simulators/emulators, tools
• Project Structure - Monorepo vs separate repos, organization
• Git Workflow - Branching, commits, PRs
• Build System - Local builds, hot reload, debugging
• Deployment - Getting apps onto devices
• State Management - Which libraries/patterns
• Testing - Unit, integration, manual testing
• Backend Strategy - Local storage vs cloud? Firebase, Supabase, custom APIs?
• Common Libraries - Navigation, UI, utilities

**Outcome:** Everyone has a working dev environment and understands the full SDLC. After this, you only worry about writing code.

**Second Half (~4-6 hours): Execution**

Now we build using Cursor AI:

• **Vehicle Mileage Tracker** (Avinash's request) - Track odometer readings, visualize trends
• **Construction Expense Tracker** (Sai's request) - Track expenses by partner, calculate profit distribution
• **Your own ideas** - Bring them and build them

Just focus on writing code with AI assistance. All the hard decisions are already made in the first half.

**Why this structure matters:**

After this hackathon, building a mobile app should feel as natural as vibe coding an API. No more "I wish I could build this" - just build it. That's the goal.

See you Monday! 🚀
