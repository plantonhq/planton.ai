Meeting Title: Auto Esop mobile app planning and requirements gathering
Date: Dec 22

Transcript:
 
Me: So this is about building. An app called auto esop. When I say app, it is a mobile app. And. There is a questionnaire that sir gave me. To. Ask the two help me. Create a discussion, write document. So that based on that discussion, Discussions transcript. Again due to cursor and cursor. Will start working on creating the. App. Questionnaire. I'll go through those questions. And try to answer. Most of them. I'm going to write space. To. Answer all those questions. That's what I believe. And yeah. Let's all so the purpose of this thing is to use auto reserve as a concrete example to make all technical decisions needed for mobile development. By the end of this discussion, every question about platform tools, workflow and architecture should be answered. What is auto esop? If you will. Refill tracker that calculates weighted mileage fuel efficiency. Every time refuel you log the odometer reading. And fuel quantity. The app calculus, distance travel and mileage between vehicles showing fuel efficiency trends over time. How to use this guide. Go through sessions in order each schedules on previous ones. Capture decisions as you go, okay? So that's about the document. And like I said, I will go through each of those questions. And I'll try to answer. The first section is product scope and requirements and. So basically the core use case is the fundamental workflow is user refused their vehicular gas station, user opens auto hisop, user logs current odometer reading. Plus fuel quantity added. App calculates distance travel current rating minus previous reading and mileage equals to distance fuel quantity. And distance will be in kilometers. Fuel quantity will be in liters. Yeah. User access manage over time. This is the core use case that we are trying to solve through this app. And yeah, when it comes to user profile, who is the primary user? I would say business. There are three options. Personal use where individual tracking their own vehicle. Family Use multiple family members. Tracking shared vehicles. Business use fleet manager tracking company vehicles. So it's actually personal use, but a single user can track multiple vehicles. And. How many vehicles will a typical user track? It will be any number of vehicles, but let's say more than five. The options that were given is one, two to three vehicles and five plus vehicles. So let's consider it as five plus vehicles, but there won't be any share in of information. Like we want to keep this scope as simple as possible and. Yeah. We want to keep the scope as simple as possible. That's the philosophy, because this is the first mobile app that we are trying to build. What's the absolute minimum? Viable product. So the essential features that listed by Qshare is log, fuel refill, automedonative mass, fuel quantity. Auto, calculate mileage between refills. View Refill History List of Refill List of all refills. View Mileage Trends chart showing efficiency over time here. There are other nice two have features, but I'm not bringing up here because we're not going to. Implement all those things. Now. MEPS data model. What data needs to be captured for each refill entry. Automated reading, fuel quantity, date and time. Field type can be one thing, like petrol, diesel or cng. Your nodes could be another thing. That's it. What to capture. How is mileage calculated? They are standard calculation. Distance equals to current automated Minus previous automator and mileage equals to distance by fuel quantity. That's it. Don't worry about the edge cases. It's okay. If we get errors for such edge cases. Reports and analytics. What insights does the user need? Core analytics, current mileage, weight test, calculated value, average mileage over last year. Time period Mileage Trend chart Line graph over time Best mileage Highest efficiency recorded Was mileage Lowest efficiency recorded. And financial analytics. Total fuel expenses, cost per km, fuel expense trends. Yeah. Total fuel expenses can be part of this because. How much has been planned in this month, the year and not that can be a good number to have and cost per km. If it is easy to calculate, then let's do that. Fuel expense. Yeah, we can have that as well. Comparison analytics. CT versus Highway. Let's not do that. I believe it is complicated. Summer versus winter. We can do that because we are capturing the new attribute that has to be shown. But for CTM highway, then we need to have that GPS geographical location thing, all those things. Let's now go with ctos. We're adding complexity over there and compare across vehicles. Yes, we can do that. Like if user has multiple vehicles, then we can have a compassion. As well. Do users need to share or collaborate on data? No single user, only partial tracking. User experience and interaction patterns. Walk through the most common user action Logging Refill yes user just refueled at the gas steering the car Quick entry open app see add refill is giving three options we can get Photo Assistant Voice entry Quick entry is the most common user action. Like we won't be having photos entry and voice entry. They're out of scope. So the quick entry flow will be like user will open the app, user sees this add repeal button. Prominently, they click on that and they enter parameter reading. Keyboard input and end of fuel quantity, which is a keyword Interpol. And they tap on save. And they see calculated mileage immediately. Yeah. Other flows are not required. How often will users interact with the app? Every review. There won't be any batch entry. Daily review? I don't know. Depends upon. The user. Mostly users will check when they are refueling it, but yeah, daily. If user want to do that. And depends upon. The type of user. If it's a business user and you want to check. If you want to managing multiple vehicles. And you might do it. There's no affirmative answer. This answer for that. 's how it is. What's the home screen and QASR gave us three options. One is dashboard, refill history and mileage chart. I would say we will go with dashboard which will have current vehicles, latest mileage, recent refills, add refill, prominent button, quick stats. Average mileage total expense this month. Those things. Refund history and mileage at. Mean? We can have them as other screens, but not as. One which will appear over the app is open. Ed and input methods. How does user enter data? Yeah. Odometer reading, keyboard and fuel quantity also through keyboard only. No photo plus OCR thing, no voice input, no increment last reading thing. Just keyword entry, whatever that is there in order, fuel quantity that has been refilled. Must the app work offline? Yeah, we discuss. Internally, and we decided that the app will only work offline. There won't be any back end. So data storage will be stored locally only. What devices do users need to access from phone only? Tablet, desktop or smartwatch is not required. What's the data review or analysis workflow? User wants to understand their fuel efficiency. As they want to view mileage chat last six months, identify trend improving or selling or stable. And yeah, exporting data is not required. So I think we can target the first two options. And platform choice decision. We'll be using flutter. That has been decided. And does Auto Hisab need camera access? No manual keyboard entry only. Does it need GPS location services? No, location is not required right now. We'll see. Right now. Let's keep it simple. And no gps thing. Does it need background processing? I think background processing not required. Yeah. I think even. Cursor says that background processing is complex. And our funder is keep it simple. Anything that is close to complex, we want to avoid. So let's not do that. What are the performance requirements? Simple forms are list low complexity. That's one option which, because I gave for this question, And since it says that it is low complexity, and that's our primary. Motto to choose. Make these choices. So let's go with that. Simple forms analysis. And what does the team already know? Your team knows JavaScript, TypeScript, React. Team doesn't know Dart Swift Kotlin, but we rely heavily on we are not going to team is not going to write a single line of code and. We are promoting wire coding, so we'll be using cursor and through wire coding only. This app has to be built. No point in me. Giving ratings. For. Our knowledge on these technologies. What are the mobile apps do we want to build after autoheops? Right now? I don't have a list, but there is one thing which is Construction expense tracker. Which has been noted. But right now. I don't have a list, but. If everything went well, I'm planning to. Implement one app per week. That's the habit that I want to build. Who will maintain this code long term. So team left wing will maintain this thing called long term. And we already have. Left bin. Mobile. Apps. Organization in GitHub, which we will be using. So we'll create git repositories over there. Developer environment setup which IDE we are going to use cursor. Android, Studio X Studio. All those things are already installed. Simulators part has been figured out. Physical device testing is also being figured out. We know how to connect our devices. Development workflow. How fast does hot reload need to be? I don't know. Right now. I can't measure that fastness or give you a number. I. Don't know. Whatever. So. Whatever. Right now. Actually, we are not worried. About the performance improvements as well. We just want that first app to be built. So we'll see once we face those issues. Of. Performance issues of particular issues. What debugging tools are essential. Like debugging. We are not worried about it because we are not going to write code. Even if we have to debug, then we heavily rely on cursor to do the debugging. We don't care. How will we handle different API endpoints? Like, right now we only have one environment, and like I said, there's no back end. So no point of this question. Project structure and organization. It will be separate reports for each of these mobile apps. Like I said, we already have an organization Latvian Aqua mobile app and app. There we will be having these apps. One repository for one app. Where does the repo leave? Yeah, like I said. Left behind mobile apps. Organization. How should code be organized? Oh. This. I don't know what is based on the best practice. Of how people. Do build mobile apps. Using flutter Whatever. The best practices. That Internet. Advisors or Internet sales, then that is it. We don't want. To enforce anything. How will shared code be managed? Right now, we are not going to maintain any shared code or utilities or components, everything. Every app will be independent. Yes. Asset manager strategy. For now, we'll have all. The images, icons, fonts. In the code repository only. We'll see once we hit that performance bottlenecks. Then we'll try to optimize it. But right now, locally in the git repository, Git workflow. Git workflow. Nothing. New that we are going to do. All. For pro questions. I only want to say that whatever we are doing for other repositories will do it here also. Nothing special that I want to highlight or say anything. State management. This is again, kind of implementation detail, and I want Cursor to understand the requirement and take the right decision of how the state management has to be done. I am no expert to give that or. We don't want that decision to be taken. As humans. We want AI to figure out that part. And if, in case. It is track. That's when we can ask the question. And we'll bring some. Expert advice. Or we'll bring someone who has worked on it and then get that shock. But in the initial implementation, We completely rely on. Data synchronization. There's no concept of data synchronization. We come to. Like I said. The data will be local and if user deletes the app, the data is lost. We'll come back and discuss. These problems once. We agree on having a backend. So backend strategy. There's no point of discussing back end strategy because it is going to be local storage only apps. And. We are going to use Hive for the local storage. And, yeah, data model for backend. Like I said. No point in discussing that because we don't have backend authentication strategy. I think we don't need any user accounts. Like it is local device only, so anonymous usage. Data backup and export. No, we don't guarantee data backups or exports, or we don't give that as a feature sync strategy. Irrelevant because we don't have backend common libraries and dependencies. Nothing. I want to highlight. I want. This section also to. Be really on AI to make the right decision for us. As I was saying. We'll bring in. Some human expert who can answer those questions. But the initial decisions have to be taken by. A. And date and time again. There is some packages that. Curser is asking us to answer for. But like I said, I want AI to take the decision charts and visualization. AI to take the right decision of which package. Is the right camera access. We don't have camera access. Local database. Like I said, we are going to use Hive. HTTP client irrelevant because there's no backend UI component library again. Relevant AI to take the right decision, which library to use. Build system. How do we build? What command? Start the app? I think Flutter. Since we are using flutter, we will use flutter. And we have already had that setup ready. So we have a meeting. Recording. Which explains how. This local bridge. They have to be started. So we are clear on that part. What's the hot reload workflow? Yeah, again, we have that. We have that answered. And everyone in the team is aware of how the real world workflow has to be set up. And build configurations. Right now there is only production, so no point in build configurations. There's no environment variables because there is no single. Environment, and right now we don't have any window and variables to save as such. We'll take the decision once. We face some problem where we need that? And asset bundling how our images and fonts included. Again some decision. Earlier I mentioned the files will be there locally only. I would realize since we are using Flutter and you say that it has to be declared in hubspec YAML and reference should be like image asset. Let's go with that approach. And code signing for production home manager certificates and provisioning. We'll discuss on that. In our next hackathon or a next meeting because. Right now. We want this app to be built and just want to start it. In one of the emulators. So that will be a good. That would be. A good this thing. Goal that we can achieve. For this hackathon. Since this is the first time that we are building mobile apps as a team. And testing strategy. We are not worried about testing strategies. We don't want any automation. We do manual testing since we are picking these small apps, micro apps. We would. For now, with this manual testing, we'll figure out. The automation later point of time. Deployment. Again. Right now. I'm not worried about it. And we as a team will take care of this deployment flow. Next hackathon or. Meetings where? We. Again start. The second round. Phase two, I would say we'll handle all these things. Phase 2. And over the air updates. Again. This comes under that deployment part only. We'll do it later. Production, distribution. Will handle version management. We'll do that later. Release process. We'll do that later. Decision summary. Yes, that's it. These are all the questions. Hope you answered everything that is required. stop
