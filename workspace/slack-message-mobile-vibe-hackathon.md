🚀 **Mobile Vibe Hackathon - Dec 22: Let's Build Mobile Apps Together!**

Hey team! 👋

**TL;DR:** Mobile app hackathon this Monday (Dec 22) - we'll establish our mobile dev workflow together, then build real apps using Cursor AI. Just show up at 9 AM!

---

**The Story Behind This Hackathon**

Back in 2020, I knew zero about building APIs. Swaroop and I had a 30-minute call where he explained the foundational choices that would enable me to just focus on writing code:

• Programming language: Java
• Database: PostgreSQL  
• Protocol: gRPC
• Git workflow, project structure, SDLC

By the end of that call, I had one job left: **write the code**. All other decisions were made. That 30-minute foundation enabled 5 years of productive API development.

**Today, we're in the same situation with mobile apps.**

We want to build mobile apps. We have Cursor AI (vibe coding) to help us write code. But we don't know:
• Which platform? (React Native, Flutter, Native?)
• How to set up dev environments?
• Where to store our code?
• How to build, test, and deploy?
• Which libraries to use?
• Do we even need backends?

**This hackathon will be that 30-minute call - but for mobile development.**

---

**The Two-Phase Agenda**

**Phase 1: Foundation Setup (First Half - ~4 hours)**

Swaroop leads as teacher/decision-maker. We learn together.

We'll make all the technical decisions needed to normalize mobile app development at Planton Cloud:

• Mobile Platform: React Native vs Flutter vs Native iOS/Android
• Development Environment: IDE setup, simulators/emulators, required tools
• Project Structure: Monorepo vs separate repos, folder organization
• Git Workflow: Branching strategy, commit conventions, PR process
• Build System: Local builds, hot reload, debugging setup
• Deployment: How to get apps onto devices, app store preparation
• State Management: Which libraries/patterns to use
• Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, manual testing workflow
• Backend Strategy: Do apps need backends? Local storage vs cloud? (Firebase, Supabase, custom API, etc.)
• Common Libraries: Navigation, UI components, utilities

**Outcome:** Everyone leaves Phase 1 with a working dev environment and clear understanding of the full SDLC - ready to just write code.

**Phase 2: Execution (Second Half - ~4-6 hours)**

Everyone builds using Cursor AI.

Now we apply what we learned in Phase 1 and build actual apps:

• **Vehicle Mileage Tracker** (requested by Avinash) - Track odometer readings, visualize mileage trends
• **Construction Expense Tracker** (requested by Sai) - Track construction expenses by partner, calculate profit distribution
• **Your own app ideas!** - Bring them and build them

Focus exclusively on writing code with AI assistance. All the hard decisions are already made.

**Roles & Expectations**

**Swaroop:** Teacher and technical decision-maker (like in 2020)  
**Everyone else:** Students - ask questions, learn, take notes

**After this hackathon, you should only worry about writing code for mobile apps.** Everything else will be figured out and documented.

---

**Logistics**

📅 **When:** Monday, December 22, 2025 @ 9:00 AM  
🌐 **Where:** Hybrid - join in-person at office or remotely from home  
⏱️ **Duration:** Full day (8-10 hours) with flexible breaks  
✋ **RSVP:** Super informal - just react to this message for headcount, or just show up!  
💻 **What to bring:** Your laptop, your enthusiasm, your app ideas

---

**Why This Matters**

There are so many small ideas that could benefit our team and community - productivity tools, hobby projects, personal utilities. Right now, those ideas stay ideas because we don't have the mobile dev workflow established.

After this hackathon, building a mobile app will be as natural as vibe coding an API. No more "I wish I could build this" - just build it.
