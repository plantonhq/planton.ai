## Handling Common Questions

### "Why not just use AWS/GCP directly?"
**Answer**: For the same reason developers use Vercel instead of raw AWS - simplicity and speed without sacrificing control. Planton abstracts complexity but still uses standard tools underneath.

### "What's your differentiation from Terraform/Pulumi?"
**Answer**: We're not replacing IaC tools - we're built on top of them. We provide the orchestration layer, templates, and developer experience. Terraform is the engine; we're the car.

### "How do you compete with Vercel/Render/Railway?"
**Answer**: They focus on frontend or simple PaaS. We're for the entire backend infrastructure - databases, Kubernetes, networking, multi-cloud. Think "Vercel for everything backend."

### "Why seed-stage with only $800 MRR?"
**Answer**: Developer tools often have this profile - product-first, revenue follows. GitHub, Postman, HashiCorp all raised seed pre-revenue or with minimal revenue. We have a production platform and paying customers validating fit.

### "What's the moat?"
**Answer**: Three layers:
1. **Developer experience** - accumulated UX learnings and polish
2. **Multi-cloud orchestration** - complex system with dependencies, not trivial
3. **Community and ecosystem** - open-source foundation builds lock-in through adoption

### "Why become a cloud provider? Isn't that risky?"
**Answer**: It's a phased approach with controlled risk:
- **Phase 1** (Today-Series A): Scale the DevOps platform
- **Phase 2** (Series A+): Become software cloud provider - build API/control plane layer on top of Hetzner/OVH (no hardware ownership)
- **Phase 3** (Series B+): Eventually own hardware for full vertical integration
We're software-first - master the experience layer before touching hardware.

### "Why India? Why not Silicon Valley?"
**Answer**: Capital efficiency. We can build for 1/3 the cost in India without compromising quality. Market is global (US/EU), but engineering can be done anywhere. Postman did this successfully - India-built, globally loved.

### "Solo founder risk?"
**Answer**: Not truly solo - Suresh is co-founder (joining cap table soon). Also have a core team of 5 people who've worked together for years. Post-funding, we'll expand to reduce key-person risk.
