## 🎬 Your First Actions (In Order)

### Action 1: View the Deck (10 minutes)
```bash
# Open in browser
open http://planton.ai/investor-deck

# Or if dev server not running:
cd /path/to/planton.ai
npm run dev
# Then open http://localhost:3000/investor-deck
```

Navigate through all 12 slides. Get familiar with flow.

### Action 2: Read Your Guide (15 minutes)
Choose based on timing:
- Meeting today? → QUICK-START.md
- This week? → START-HERE.md  
- Exploring? → SUMMARY.md

### Action 3: Practice Opening (10 minutes)
From talking-points.md, memorize this:

*"I'm Swarup, founder of Planton Cloud. I've been a DevOps engineer at companies from 1-person startups to 500-developer orgs. Everywhere I worked, I saw the same problem: dev teams waste half their time deploying infrastructure across different clouds.*

*So I spent 2 years and $500K of my own money building what I call 'Vercel for backend infrastructure.'*

*We have early revenue, production customers, and a vision to become the next Postman from India. Let me show you."*

Say it out loud 3 times.

### Action 4: Identify First 3 Investors (15 minutes)
Open target-investors.md and pick 3 investors where you:
- Have warm intro path, OR
- See strong alignment with their thesis

Write them down. These are your first targets.

### Action 5: Take Action (Now!)
Don't just read. Do:
- [ ] Email 1 advisor for feedback
- [ ] Practice pitch once (record yourself)
- [ ] Draft 1 warm intro request
- [ ] Schedule time for more practice

## 💡 What Investors Will Think

### After Slide 3 (Solution)
*"Okay, this is interesting. Multi-cloud is a real pain. Let me see if they have traction..."*

### After Slide 6 (Traction)
*"$800 MRR is tiny, but they have a working product and paying customers. That validates something."*

### After Slide 7-8 (Vision)
*"AI agents and cloud provider? That's ambitious. Can they execute?"*

### After Slide 11 (Team)
*"Solo founder is risky, but $500K invested and platform shipped proves execution. Post-funding hiring plan makes sense."*

### After Slide 12 (Ask)
*"$500K at $6-8M cap is reasonable for this stage. 12-month milestones are clear. This could work."*

**Your job**: Guide them to "yes" by answering concerns before they ask.

## 🚨 Most Important Things

### 1. Start Pitching This Week
The deck is ready. Don't wait for perfect.

### 2. Practice Before First Real Pitch
Do at least 3 practice runs. Record yourself.

### 3. Be Honest About Traction
$800 MRR is honest. Product maturity matters more at seed.

### 4. Show Passion
Your conviction is your best asset. Let it show.

### 5. Follow Up Fast
Send email within 24 hours of every meeting. Speed wins.

## 📞 When Investors Ask...

### "Why solo founder?"
"I've proven I can ship solo. Hiring immediately with funding - ML engineer, growth lead, senior devs ready to join."

### "How will you compete with Terraform?"
"Different value prop. Terraform is for experts. We're for developers who don't want to become Terraform experts."

### "Isn't $800 MRR too small?"
"Standard for dev tools at seed - product maturity matters more. Postman raised seed with tiny revenue. We have working product + paying customers."

### "AI agents sound ambitious?"
"Using existing LLMs, not building from scratch. Innovation is in prompts and domain knowledge. PoC working. ML hire accelerates it."

### "Cloud provider seems like distraction?"
"Long-term vision, not current focus. This money is for platform. Cloud provider is Phase 2, Series A+ territory."
