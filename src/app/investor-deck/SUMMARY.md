## Your Pitch in 30 Seconds (Elevator Version)

*"I'm Swarup, founder of Planton Cloud. Think Vercel, but for backend infrastructure.*

*Dev teams waste half their time deploying across AWS, GCP, Azure - different tools, different APIs, same frustration. We built a platform that makes multi-cloud deployments as simple as git push.*

*We have 150+ deployment components, early revenue, customers in production. Next up: AI agent fleet to automate DevOps - like having 10 expert engineers available 24/7.*

*Raising $500K to hire ML engineer, growth lead, and scale. Would love to show you what we've built."*

---

## Your Pitch in 2 Minutes (Email Version)

*"I've been a DevOps engineer at companies from 1-person startups to 500-developer orgs. One pain kept repeating: deploying infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and Azure requires learning completely different tools and APIs for the same tasks.*

*So I built Planton Cloud - think Vercel's git-push experience, but for backend infrastructure. We provide:*
- *InfraHub: 150+ deployment components with consistent YAML across all clouds*
- *ServiceHub: Automatic CI/CD from GitHub to production*  
- *Open-source foundation: Everything transparent and extensible*

*Early validation: $800 MRR, 5-10 production customers, 2+ years of engineering invested. I've put in $500K of my own money.*

*The vision: Build AI agent fleet (Cursor for DevOps) - specialized agents that automate different DevOps tasks. Long-term: become a simpler cloud provider (like Render, Railway) focused on essential 20% of services.*

*Raising $500K on $6-8M cap to hire ML engineer, growth lead, and hit $50K MRR in 12 months. Aiming to build the Postman of DevOps from India.*

*Would love 15 minutes to show you the platform and discuss the opportunity."*

1. Express enthusiasm (but stay professional)
2. Ask about their process and timeline
3. Provide any additional materials they request
4. Introduce to existing customers for reference checks
5. Be responsive (reply within hours, not days)

**Due diligence prep**:

- Legal docs clean (incorporation, IP, etc.)

---

## If You Get a "No"

### When Investor Passes

**Immediate actions**:
1. Thank them for their time
2. Ask for specific feedback: "What made this a pass?"
3. Ask if it could be a fit later: "What milestones would change your mind?"
4. Request intros: "Know anyone who might be interested?"

---

## Numbers to Update Regularly

**Traction metrics**:
- MRR: $800 → $___
- Customers: ___ signed, ___ in trials
- Open-source: ___ GitHub stars, ___ downloads/week

**Team**:
- Solo → ___ (update once you hire)
- Advisors: Add names once formalized

---

## The Most Important Thing

**This deck is a tool, not the outcome.**

The real work is:
1. **Building a great product** (you've done this)
2. **Talking to customers** (keep doing this)
3. **Finding the right investors** (this deck helps)
4. **Telling your story with conviction** (practice makes perfect)

You've built something real. You've invested $500K of your own money. You have customers paying you. You have a bold vision.

**Now go tell that story and raise the capital to accelerate.**
