## Who to Ask for Feedback

### Ideal Advisor Profile (Pick 2-3)

**1. Experienced Founder** (Best choice)
- Someone who has raised seed/Series A
- Preferably in dev tools or B2B SaaS
- Understands investor perspective
- Example: Friend who raised from VCs you're targeting

**2. Angel Investor or VC** (If accessible)
- Someone who invests at seed stage
- Bonus: Invests in infra/dev tools
- Can give real investor perspective
- Example: Angel in your network, or friend-of-friend VC

**3. Senior DevOps/Platform Engineer** (Technical validation)
- Someone who would be your customer
- Can validate: Is the problem real? Is solution compelling?
- Bonus: Works at mid-size company (your target segment)
- Example: Ex-colleague at 500-person tech company

**4. Product/Marketing Leader** (Storytelling)
- Someone great at messaging/positioning
- Can help tighten narrative
- Bonus: B2B experience
- Example: Head of Product at a SaaS company

### Who NOT to Ask
- ❌ Family/friends who'll just say "looks great!"
- ❌ People with no startup/fundraising experience
- ❌ People too busy to give thoughtful feedback
- ❌ Competitors or people in sensitive positions

## How to Request Feedback

### Email Template

**Subject**: Quick favor - feedback on my investor deck?

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I'm raising a seed round for Planton Cloud (Vercel for backend infrastructure) and would love your feedback on the pitch deck before I start talking to investors.

Context:
- Raising $500K on $6-8M cap
- Multi-cloud DevOps automation platform
- $800 MRR, 2+ years building, 150+ deployment components

I specifically value your perspective because [reason: you raised from X / you invest in Y / you work in DevOps / you're great at positioning].

The deck is 12 slides, takes ~15 minutes to review. Would you be willing to:
1. Read through it once
2. Jot down gut reactions (what's confusing, what's compelling, what's missing)
3. Jump on a 20-minute call to discuss?

I'm aiming to have a polished deck by [date], so feedback in the next week would be super helpful.

One-pager: [link to one-pager for context]

Thanks so much!
Swarup

## Specific Questions to Ask

### Don't just ask "What do you think?" - Ask specific questions:

#### For Everyone:

**1. Clarity**
- "After reading the deck, can you explain back to me what Planton Cloud does?"
- "Which slide was most confusing or hard to understand?"
- "Did you have to read any slide twice to get it?"

**2. Compelling-ness**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how excited would you be to invest after reading this?"
- "What was the most compelling part?"
- "What made you skeptical or doubtful?"

**3. Story Flow**
- "Did the narrative flow logically from problem to solution to traction to vision?"
- "Were there any jarring transitions or disconnects?"
- "Did it feel too long, too short, or just right?"

**4. Credibility**
- "Do you believe I can pull this off? Why or why not?"
- "What would make you more confident in the team/execution?"

**5. The Ask**
- "Is $500K at $6-8M cap reasonable for this stage?"
- "Would you fund this if you were an investor? If not, what's missing?"

#### For Investor Advisors:

**1. "What's your biggest concern after reading this?"**

**2. "Which competitors or objections would you expect investors to bring up?"**

**3. "Is the market opportunity clear and big enough?"**

**4. "How does this compare to other seed decks you've seen? Better/worse/similar?"**

**5. "What would make this a 'hell yes' for you?"**

#### For Technical Advisors:

**1. "Does the problem resonate? Have you felt this pain?"**

**2. "Would your company consider using this? Why or why not?"**

**3. "Is the solution technically credible? Any red flags?"**

**4. "Are the competitors accurately portrayed?"**

**5. "What's missing from a technical perspective?"**

#### For Storytelling/Product Advisors:

**1. "Is the positioning clear and differentiated?"**

**2. "Which slides could be more concise?"**

**3. "Is there too much jargon or technical detail?"**

**4. "Does the deck build excitement as it progresses?"**

**5. "How can I make the story more compelling?"**

## Feedback Session Structure (20-30 minutes)

### Part 1: Let Them Talk (10 min)
- "What's your overall reaction?"
- "Walk me through your notes as you read it"
- Resist urge to explain or defend - just listen and take notes

### Part 2: Ask Your Specific Questions (10 min)
- Go through your list of questions above
- Probe for details on confusing/weak areas

### Part 3: Iterate Discussion (10 min)
- "If you could only change 3 things, what would they be?"
- "What's the one slide that needs the most work?"
- "Any examples of great decks I should look at?"

---

## How to Process Feedback

### Dos and Don'ts

**DO**:
- ✅ Listen without defending
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions
- ✅ Look for patterns (2+ people say same thing = probably true)
- ✅ Prioritize feedback from people closest to your audience
- ✅ Thank them genuinely

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Explain away every concern ("Oh you didn't get it because...")
- ❌ Implement every piece of feedback (conflicting advice is normal)
- ❌ Take it personally (they're helping you!)
- ❌ Ask for feedback then ignore it all
- ❌ Get defensive

### Pattern Recognition

**If 1 person says something**: Note it, but don't panic. Could be personal taste.

**If 2 people say something**: This is probably real. Fix it.

**If 3 people say something**: This is definitely real. Fix it ASAP.

**Example**:
- 1 person: "Slide 7 is confusing" → Maybe they just didn't read carefully
- 2 people: "Slide 7 is confusing" → Okay, slide 7 needs work
- 3 people: "Slide 7 is confusing" → Slide 7 is broken, rewrite it entirely

## Sample Feedback Questions Email

After the call, send this follow-up:

```
Hi [Name],

Thank you SO much for the feedback on my deck! The [specific feedback] was especially helpful - I've already [action you took].

Quick follow-up questions:

1. You mentioned [concern X] - would [proposed solution] address that?

2. For [slide Y], would you find it more compelling if I [option A] or [option B]?

3. Do you think I'm ready to start pitching, or should I iterate more?

Also, if you think of anyone who'd be a good fit as an investor for this (dev tools, infrastructure, seed stage), I'd love an intro. No pressure at all!

Thanks again for taking the time.

Best,
Swarup
```

## Red Flags in Feedback (When to Ignore)

Sometimes feedback is wrong. Ignore if:

**1. Conflicts with your core insight**
Example: "You should just focus on AWS, multi-cloud isn't real"
→ If you know from experience multi-cloud is real, stick to your guns

**2. Suggests diluting your positioning**
Example: "You should be for everyone, not just mid-market"
→ Niche positioning is good. Resist urge to boil the ocean.

**3. Personal preference masquerading as feedback**
Example: "I don't like blue, use green"
→ Unless 3 people say it, ignore aesthetic preferences

**4. Asks you to be something you're not**
Example: "You need a co-founder before you can raise"
→ Many solos have raised. Don't lie about your situation.

**5. Outside their expertise**
Example: Technical person critiquing financial projections
→ Weight feedback by advisor's domain expertise

---

## Success Criteria

**You know your deck is ready when:**

✅ 2+ advisors say "I'd invest in this" or "This is compelling"
✅ No one is confused about what you do
✅ Objections are mostly about execution risk, not concept
✅ Investors in the group say it's "investor-ready"
✅ You can pitch it without looking at slides (you know it by heart)

**You know you need more work when:**

❌ Multiple people confused about core value prop
❌ Advisors say "not ready" or "needs more traction"
❌ No one expresses excitement or interest
❌ Lots of questions about "what is this?"
❌ Feedback is all over the place (no clear issues)

## Quick Wins (Easy Improvements)

Based on common feedback across many decks:

**1. Add Concrete Numbers**
- Replace "many" with "50+"
- Replace "significant" with "$500K"
- Replace "growing fast" with "100% MoM"

**2. Cut Text by 50%**
- Most slides have too much text
- Aim for 3-5 bullets max
- <50 words per slide

**3. Lead with Outcomes**
- Instead of "We have 150 components"
- Say "150 deployment components = 2 years of engineering = hard to replicate"

**4. Add Faces**
- People invest in people
- Put your photo in team slide
- Consider customer/advisor logos (with permission)

**5. Make Ask Crystal Clear**
- Don't bury it
- Slide title: "The Ask"
- First line: "$500K on SAFE at $6-8M cap"

## Feedback is a Gift

Remember: People who give you honest, critical feedback are doing you a HUGE favor. 

The investors won't tell you why they passed. These advisors will tell you exactly what's wrong so you can fix it.

Be grateful. Be open. Be willing to change.

Your deck will be 10x better after this process.
