## Your Mantra

**Before every pitch, remind yourself:**

*"I've built something real. I've invested $500K of my own money. I have customers paying me. I have a bold vision. I'm the right person to build this. I will make this happen - with or without them. But with them, we get there faster."*

But you have:
- ✅ A working product

**You have everything you need to succeed.**
