# Quick Start - Ready for Your Meeting Today

## You Have a Meeting in a Few Hours? Here's What to Do:

---

## 1. Review the Deck (10 minutes)

Open: **planton.ai/investor-deck**

- Navigate through all 12 slides using arrow keys
- Read each slide out loud once
- Make sure you understand the flow
- Note any numbers you want to update

---

## 2. Memorize Your Opening (5 minutes)

**Your opening hook** (say this from memory):

*"I'm Swarup, founder of Planton Cloud. I've been a DevOps engineer at companies from 1-person startups to 500-developer organizations. And everywhere I worked, I saw the same problem: dev teams waste half their time deploying infrastructure across different clouds - AWS, GCP, Azure - each with completely different tools and APIs.*

*So I spent 2 years and $500K of my own money building what I call 'Vercel for backend infrastructure' - a platform that makes multi-cloud DevOps as simple as git push.*

*We have early revenue, production customers, and a vision to become the next Postman from India. Let me show you."*

Practice this 3 times out loud.

---

## 3. Memorize Your Close (5 minutes)

**Your closing ask** (say this from memory):

*"So that's Planton Cloud. We've built a working product. We have customers paying us. We have a bold vision with AI agents and potentially becoming a cloud provider.*

*I'm raising $500K on a SAFE at $6-8M cap. This gives us 12-18 months to hit $50K in monthly revenue, launch our AI agent beta, and sign enterprise pilots.*

*I've proven I can build and ship. With this capital, I'll hire the team to scale. This is the next Postman of DevOps from India.*

*Are you in?"*

Practice this 3 times out loud.

## 5. Prepare 3 Answers (5 minutes)

You WILL get asked these. Know your answers:

### Q1: "Why solo founder?"
**Answer**: "I started solo to move fast. I've proven I can ship. Post-funding, I'm hiring immediately - ML engineer, growth lead, senior devs. I have candidates ready. Not staying solo."

### Q2: "How will you compete with Terraform?"
**Answer**: "Different value prop. Terraform is for infrastructure experts. We're for developers who don't want to become Terraform experts. We abstract the complexity, consistent experience across clouds."

### Q3: "What's your unfair advantage?"
**Answer**: "Four things: One, founder-market fit - I lived the pain. Two, 150-component head start - 2 years of work. Three, open-source community building trust. Four, capital efficiency from India."

- Feel yourself answering smoothly
- Watch them nodding, understanding
- Hear them say "This is interesting, let's continue the conversation"

**Affirmation** (say out loud):
"I've got this. I know my product. I know my market. I'm the right person to build this. Let's go."

## If You're Nervous (Totally Normal!)

### Remember:

**They're human too**: Investors are just people. They want to find great companies to invest in. You might be that company.

**You have leverage**: You're offering them an opportunity, not begging. Good investors know great founders are rare.

**Rejection is normal**: Even the best startups get rejected by 90%+ of investors. It's a numbers game.

**You're prepared**: You have a great deck, a working product, real traction. You know your stuff.

**Worst case**: They say no. That's it. You learn and pitch the next investor.

**Best case**: They say yes. You get capital to build the next Postman.

## Emergency Tips

### If Demo Breaks
"Let me show you a screen recording instead - I have it prepared."

### If You Blank on a Number
"I don't have that exact number in my head, but I can get it to you today."

### If They Ask Something You Don't Know
"That's a great question I haven't thought deeply about. Let me research that and get back to you."

### If They Seem Uninterested
"I want to make sure I'm covering what's most relevant to you - what would be most valuable for me to focus on?"

### If You're Running Out of Time
"I see we're short on time. Let me jump to the key points..." [Go to slides 6, 11, 12]

## The Only Things That Actually Matter

1. **Show confidence** (even if you don't feel it)
2. **Tell your story clearly** (problem, solution, traction, vision, ask)
3. **Demonstrate passion** (you believe in this!)
4. **End with a clear ask** (are you in?)

Everything else is details.

---

## ONE LAST THING

**Before you walk in that door (or join that Zoom):**

Take a deep breath.

Remember why you built this: To make DevOps simple. To help developers ship faster. To build a global company from India.

You've come this far. You've built a real product. You have real customers.

**You deserve this investment.**

Now go get it. 🚀

*Good luck! You've got this!*
