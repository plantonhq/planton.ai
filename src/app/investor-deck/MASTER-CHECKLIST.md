## Red Flags (Stop and Reassess If...)

### Fundraising Red Flags
🚩 50+ investor contacts, <5 meetings (deck or intro quality issue)
🚩 10+ pitches, zero term sheets (positioning or traction issue)
🚩 Multiple investors say "come back when you have more traction" (too early)
🚩 Multiple investors say "market too small" (positioning issue)
🚩 3+ months fundraising, no close (need to adjust valuation or terms)

### Product/Market Red Flags
🚩 MRR not growing (product-market fit issue)
🚩 High churn (product quality issue)
🚩 No organic signups (marketing/positioning issue)
🚩 Low usage (product value issue)

### Team/Execution Red Flags
🚩 Can't hire after closing round (compensation or mission issue)
🚩 Founder burnout (need to pace yourself!)
🚩 Missing milestones badly (over-promised)
🚩 Co-founder conflict (if you bring one on)

**If you see red flags, pause and address them. Don't just push through.**
