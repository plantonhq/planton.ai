### During Fundraising

**DO**:

- ✅ Show passion and conviction
- ✅ Ask investors for feedback even if they pass
- ✅ Follow up within 24 hours after every meeting
- ✅ Keep building product (don't stop shipping!)

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Lie or exaggerate numbers
- ❌ Bash competitors
- ❌ Take rejection personally
- ❌ Stop talking to customers
- ❌ Put all your focus on fundraising (keep building!)

### Red Flags to Watch For

**Good investors**:
- Ask thoughtful questions about product and market
- Introduce you to their portfolio companies
- Give clear timeline for decision
- Provide helpful feedback even if passing

**Bad investors**:
- Ask for free consulting ("can you analyze our portfolio company?")
- Drag out process indefinitely
- Ask for exclusivity without term sheet
- Don't return calls/emails

---

## Backup Plans

### If Fundraising Takes Longer Than Expected
- **Plan A**: Extend runway by cutting personal salary
- **Plan B**: Focus on growing MRR to cover burn
- **Plan C**: Bridge round from angels ($50-100K)
- **Plan D**: Apply to YC or accelerator for instant credibility

### If Multiple Investors Want In
- **Plan A**: Take money from best value-add investor
- **Plan B**: Increase round size slightly ($500K → $750K)
- **Plan C**: Keep list of interested investors for Series A

### If Investors Want More Traction
- **Plan A**: Set milestone (e.g., "$5K MRR") and re-engage
- **Plan B**: Show growth trajectory (3 months of MoM data)
- **Plan C**: Land 1-2 notable enterprise pilots as proof
