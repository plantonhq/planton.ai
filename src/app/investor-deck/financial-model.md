## Unit Economics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Current** (mostly free/organic):
- CAC: ~$500 per customer
- Channels: Open-source, content, word-of-mouth

**Scaled** (with sales team):
- CAC: ~$5K per customer
- Channels: Inside sales, partners, paid ads

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Assumptions**:
- Avg customer life: 36 months
- Annual churn: 10-15%
- Avg ACV: $10K (Year 1) → $30K (Year 3)
- Gross margin: 85%

**LTV Calculation**:
- $30K ACV × 3 years × 85% margin = $76.5K LTV

**LTV:CAC Ratio**: 15:1 (target: 3:1, so very healthy)

### Payback Period
- CAC: $5K
- Monthly gross profit: $2.1K (assuming $30K ACV)
- Payback: 2.4 months (excellent)

---

## Break-Even Analysis

**Fixed Costs** (at scale):
- Engineering: $1.5M/year (10 engineers at $150K avg)
- Sales & Marketing: $800K/year (5 people)
- G&A: $500K/year (ops, legal, accounting, tools)
- Infrastructure: $200K/year (cloud costs, SaaS tools)
- **Total**: $3M/year

**Revenue needed**:
- At 85% gross margin: $3M / 0.85 = $3.53M ARR
- At $30K ACV: 118 customers
- At $50K ACV: 71 customers

**Estimate**: Break-even at **$5M ARR** with team of 25-30

## Key Assumptions

### Growth Rates
- Customer growth: 20-30% QoQ (Year 1), 15-25% QoQ (Year 2)
- ARPU growth: 10% YoY (moving upmarket)
- Churn: 10-15% annually (target: <10% by Year 3)

- Gross margin: 85% (SaaS typical, low COGS)
- Infrastructure: 5% of revenue (scales with usage)

### Market Assumptions
- TAM: $15B (DevOps automation market)
- SAM: $5B (multi-cloud companies)
- Target penetration: 0.1% by Year 3 (600 customers)

### Risks to Model
- Slower customer acquisition (mitigation: increase marketing spend)
- Higher churn (mitigation: improve product, customer success)
- Pricing pressure (mitigation: demonstrate ROI, bundle features)

## Investment Return Scenarios

### Base Case (Expected)
- 5-year ARR: $20M
- Valuation: $200M (10x ARR)
- Investor return: 25x ($500K → $12.5M)

### Bull Case (Optimistic)
- 5-year ARR: $50M
- Valuation: $500M (10x ARR, or higher multiple for hypergrowth)
- Investor return: 60x ($500K → $30M)

### Bear Case (Pessimistic)
- 5-year ARR: $5M
- Valuation: $25M (5x ARR for slow-growth)
- Investor return: 3x ($500K → $1.5M)

### Home Run (Cloud provider success)
- 7-year ARR: $100M+
- Valuation: $1B+ (Unicorn)
- Investor return: 125x+ ($500K → $62.5M+)

**Rationale for multiples**:
- SaaS companies typically trade at 5-15x ARR
- High-growth dev tools (Postman, Temporal, Pulumi) command premium multiples
- If we become cloud provider, infrastructure companies get even higher multiples
