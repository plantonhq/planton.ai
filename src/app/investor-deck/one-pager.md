# Planton Cloud - Investment One-Pager

## The Opportunity
**Vercel for Backend Infrastructure** - Making multi-cloud DevOps as simple as git push.

---

## The Problem
Dev teams waste 40% of time managing multi-cloud deployments. Infrastructure fragmentation, manual deployments, and DevOps scarcity slow down software delivery.

## The Solution
**Planton Cloud** automates multi-cloud infrastructure with Kubernetes-style consistency + git-push deployments.

- **InfraHub**: 150+ deployment components across AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes
- **ServiceHub**: Git-to-production CI/CD for containerized services  
- **Open-source foundation**: Project Planton (transparent, extensible, zero vendor lock-in)

## The Market
- **$5B+ serviceable market**, growing 25% YoY
- 100K+ companies with DevOps teams globally
- Average tooling spend: $50-200K/year per company
- Target: Mid-market SaaS companies (500-2000 employees)

## Traction
- **$800 MRR** (validates value, small but growing)
- **150+ open-source deployment components** (2+ years of engineering)
- **5-10 design partners** using in production
- **Project Planton**: Open-source community building

## The Vision
1. **"Cursor for DevOps"**: AI agent fleet where each agent is a specialized DevOps expert (R&D phase, launching 2025)
2. **Become cloud provider**: Software cloud on tier-2 data centers - simpler, cheaper alternative to AWS (Phase 2, post-PMF)

## Business Model
- **Usage-based pricing**: Cloud resources managed, pipeline executions
- **Freemium**: Free tier drives adoption, convert to paid at scale
- **Target ACV**: $20-50K (SMB/mid-market), $100K+ (enterprise)

## Competition
We compete on **experience, not features**:
- vs. Terraform/Pulumi: Simpler abstractions, integrated CI/CD
- vs. PaaS (Vercel/Heroku): Full backend infra, multi-cloud flexibility
- vs. AWS/GCP: Simplified, not locked to one cloud

## Team
**Swarup Donepudi**, Founder
- DevOps engineer across 1-person startups to 500-dev orgs
- 2+ years building, $500K personal investment
- Shipped full platform solo: 150+ components, working product, first revenue

**Post-funding**: Hire ML engineer (AI agents), DevRel/growth lead, 1-2 senior devs

## The Ask
- **Raising**: $500K on SAFE
- **Valuation cap**: $6-8M
- **Use of funds**: 60% engineering, 20% GTM, 15% product, 5% ops
- **Runway**: 12-18 months to hit key milestones

## 12-Month Milestones
- Reach **$50K MRR** (60x growth)
- Launch **AI agent fleet beta** (5 specialized agents)
- Sign **10 enterprise pilots** or 50 SMB customers
- Prove multi-cloud platform value before cloud provider path

## Why Now
- Cloud complexity at breaking point (AWS: 200+ services)
- Developer experience platforms winning (Vercel raised $150M, Render $50M)
- AI breakthroughs enable DevOps automation
- India → Global SaaS proven (Postman: 98% of Fortune 500)

## The Upside
Be part of the **next Postman-scale success from India**. Early stake in platform that could become essential DevOps infrastructure.
