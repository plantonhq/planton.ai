## Outreach Strategy

### Phase 1: Warm Intros (Highest Conversion)
Target first: Investors where you have 1-2 degree connections
- Ask founders in your network who invested in them
- Use LinkedIn to find mutual connections
- Request specific intros: "I'm raising for Planton Cloud (Vercel for backend), and [Investor] invests in dev tools. Could you intro?"

### Phase 2: Cold Email (Can Work for Angels)
Subject: "Planton Cloud: Multi-cloud DevOps automation (raised $500K personal capital)"

Body:
"Hi [Name],

I'm Swarup, founder of Planton Cloud. I've invested $500K over 2 years building a multi-cloud DevOps platform (think Vercel, but for backend infrastructure).

Quick context:
- $800 MRR, 150+ deployment components, 5-10 production customers
- Open-source foundation (Project Planton)
- Raising $500K seed on $6-8M cap

I saw you invested in [relevant portfolio company]. We're solving a similar problem but for infrastructure deployment.

Would love 15 minutes to show you what we've built.

Best,
Swarup"
