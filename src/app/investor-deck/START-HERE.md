## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Start NOW
Don't wait for perfect. The deck is good enough. Start pitching this week.

### 2. Practice, Practice, Practice
Do at least 5 practice runs before your first real pitch.

### 3. Be Honest
Don't exaggerate numbers. Investors will find out. Honesty builds trust.

### 4. Show Passion
Your excitement is contagious. If you're not excited, why should they be?

### 5. Follow Up Fast
Send follow-up email within 24 hours of every meeting. Speed shows professionalism.

### 6. Keep Building
Don't stop shipping product while fundraising. Live traction is best traction.

### 7. Learn from Rejections
Every "no" teaches you something. Ask for feedback and improve.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Waiting Too Long to Start
The deck will never be perfect. Start pitching now and iterate.

### ❌ Pitching to Too Few Investors
You need to talk to 30-50 investors to close one. Don't stop at 5.

### ❌ Not Practicing
Winging it makes you look unprepared. Practice until it's second nature.

### ❌ Getting Discouraged by Rejections
Fundraising is rejection after rejection after rejection... then yes. It's normal.

### ❌ Taking First Term Sheet
If you have multiple interested, you have leverage. Talk to all before deciding.

### ❌ Stopping Product Development
Investors want to see momentum. Keep shipping features and growing MRR.

### ❌ Bad Follow-Up
Slow responses kill deals. Be responsive (within 24 hours, ideally within 4 hours).
