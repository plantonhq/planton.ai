## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `src/components/demo/DemoPage.tsx` - Updated with new screen types, imports, and switch cases
- `src/components/demo/index.ts` - Added service component exports

### New Directory
- `src/components/demo/service/` - Created new directory for Service Hub components
- `src/components/demo/service/index.ts` - Created exports file

## Design Consistency

All new screens follow the existing design patterns:
- Dark background (`#110D1F`) with white cards
- Gradient buttons (violet to purple)
- Framer Motion animations for smooth transitions
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Lucide React icons throughout
- Responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS

## Navigation

Users can navigate through all 20 screens using:
- **Next/Previous buttons** at the bottom
- **Arrow keys** (← →) for keyboard navigation
- **ESC key** to return home
- **Home button** in top-right corner

Progress bar shows current position (Step X of 19).

## Testing

To test the new screens:
1. Navigate to `/demo`
2. Click "Start Interactive Demo"
3. Use Next/Previous or arrow keys to navigate through all screens
4. All Infrastructure Hub screens come before Service Hub screens
5. Each screen is fully self-contained and demonstrates specific features

## Next Steps

The demo is now ready to showcase:
1. Complete Infrastructure Hub workflow with version control and visualization
2. Full Service Hub deployment flow from GitHub to production
3. Real customer use cases (ACME Corp example data)
4. All features mentioned in the platform demo

No additional configuration or data files are needed - all demo data is embedded in the components.
