# Rule: Docs and Blog Style (PostHog-inspired)

Purpose: Ensure all documentation and blog content for PlantonCloud follows a consistent, pragmatic, and reader-first style inspired by the tone and information architecture on posthog.com/docs.

Usage: Invoke explicitly as `@docs-style` when drafting or editing any page under `public/docs/**` or `public/blog/**` in this repository.

Scope: Applies to documentation pages (Markdown in `public/docs`) and blog posts (MD/MDX in `public/blog`).

## Voice and Tone
- Conversational, direct, and helpful. Write to the reader as “you”.
- Focus on outcomes and clarity over marketing. Keep introductions short; prioritize getting users unblocked.
- Prefer active voice, present tense, and short sentences. Avoid filler and jargon.
- Use US English and consistent terminology for PlantonCloud concepts.

## Information Architecture (mirror PostHog-style structure)
For each docs page:
- Start with a concise one-paragraph "What you’ll learn"/Summary.
- Then cover: "Prerequisites" → "Steps" → "Examples" → "Troubleshooting" → "Next steps" → "See also".
- Keep headings skimmable (H2/H3 only as needed). One concept per page when possible.

For each blog post:
- Lead with the core idea and key takeaway in the first 2–3 sentences.
- Use sections with descriptive H2s, short paragraphs, and code snippets where relevant.

## Markdown Conventions
- Use fenced code blocks with language tags (bash, yaml, json, ts, go, etc.).
- Inline code with backticks for commands, file names, and identifiers.
- Use lists for procedures and checklists; avoid long, dense paragraphs.
- Callouts: prefer blockquotes (>) with a bold lead (e.g., “Note:”) rather than custom admonitions.
- Link precisely: relative links within docs, absolute links for external resources.

## Docs Frontmatter (public/docs)
These fields power the dynamic sidebar, ordering, and metadata. Include at minimum `title` and `description`.

Required (recommended):
- `title`: Page or section title.
- `description`: 1–2 sentences for previews and SEO.

Optional:
- `icon`: One of: guide, tutorial, api, sdk, integration, migration, deployment, monitoring, security, performance, analytics, experiment, feature, survey, error, session, replay, pipeline, warehouse, ai, llm, product, web, mobile, desktop, cloud, self-host, migrate, reverse-proxy, billing, privacy, contribute, support, changelog, roadmap, blog, careers, investors, press, faq, status, soc2, hipaa, gdpr, ccpa, terms, policy.
- `order`: Number for ordering within a folder (lower first).
- `badge`: Optional short label (e.g., "Beta").
- `isExternal`: true/false to mark links that point outside the site.
- `externalUrl`: URL if `isExternal` is true.
- `category`: Optional; inferred from path if omitted.

Example (page):
```markdown
---
title: "Deploy PlantonCloud on Kubernetes"
description: "Install PlantonCloud on an existing cluster with Helm."
icon: deployment
order: 20
badge: "Beta"
---

# Deploy PlantonCloud on Kubernetes

...content...
```

Example (folder index):
```markdown
---
title: "PlantonCloud CLI"
description: "Reference and guides for the CLI."
icon: code
order: 10
---

# PlantonCloud CLI

This section contains CLI guides and references.
```

Directory conventions:
- Each section folder may include an `index.md` or `README.md` to set metadata for the folder.
- Pages inside a section use `order` to control appearance in the sidebar. Keep numbers sparse (10, 20, 30...).

## Docs Page Template
Use this skeleton for new docs pages.

```markdown
---
title: "<Actionable title>"
description: "<1–2 sentence summary>"
icon: guide
order: 10
---

# <Actionable title>

## Summary
One paragraph on what this page helps you accomplish.

## Blog Frontmatter (public/blog)
Blog posts support MD or MDX. Include at least `title`, `date`, `author`, and `tags`.

Required:
- `title`: Post title
- `date`: ISO or YYYY-MM-DD
- `author`: Array of objects with `name` and `title` (optionally bio/socials)
- `tags`: Array of strings

Optional:
- `excerpt`: 1–2 sentence preview

## Writing Guidelines (checklist)
- Start with why this matters and what the reader will achieve.
- Put the most important information first; defer background.
- Use precise headings; every section should have a clear purpose.
- Prefer copy-pastable commands and complete examples.
- Include links to next steps and related docs at the end.
- Keep paragraphs short (≤ 3 sentences where possible).
- Validate steps against the current UI/CLI.

## When in Doubt
- Default to clarity over completeness; link to deeper references.
- If a concept spans multiple concerns, split into separate pages.
