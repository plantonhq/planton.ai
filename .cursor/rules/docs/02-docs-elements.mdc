# Rule: Docs Elements and Components (Markdown-first)

Purpose: A single, reusable authoring guide for building engaging documentation pages with images, callouts, cards, checklists, code, and simple interactive patterns — using Markdown plus minimal HTML that works with our current Markdown renderer.

Usage: Invoke as `@docs-elements` alongside `@docs-style` and `@docs-sources` for any new or updated docs/blog content.

Scope: Applies to content under `public/docs/**` and `public/blog/**` in this repo. Designed for our renderer in `src/app/docs/components/MarkdownRenderer.tsx` (ReactMarkdown + GFM + rehype-raw + highlight.js), not full MDX components.

Dependencies:
- Style & tone: `@docs-style`
- Source-of-truth: `@docs-sources`

---

## Core Principles
- Markdown-first. Prefer standard Markdown and GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). Use minimal inline HTML only where needed.
- Skimmable. Short sections, descriptive H2/H3s, bullet lists, and copy-pastable snippets.
- Visual-first. Each significant concept should include at least one visual (image, diagram, short GIF/video) or a concrete code example.
- Accessible. Always add descriptive alt text, meaningful link text, and avoid images of text.
- Local assets only. Store images/videos under `public/images/**` and `public/videos/**` and reference via absolute paths (e.g., `/images/...`).

---

## Page Structure (recommended)
Follow `@docs-style` IA. Within sections, use these elements as needed:

1) Summary (what the page enables)
2) Prerequisites
3) Steps (numbered)
4) Examples (code + screenshots)
5) Troubleshooting (common pitfalls)
6) Next steps / See also

---

## Frontmatter and Naming
- Filenames: kebab-case. Prefer `index.md` for directory indexes.
- Include at least `title` and `description` in frontmatter. Use `order` in increments (10, 20, 30...) for sidebar control. See `@docs-style` for full schema.

---

## Images and Figures
- Place under `/public/images/docs/<topic>/...` when possible; otherwise reuse existing images under `/public/images/**`.
- Embed with Markdown:

```markdown
![Short, descriptive alt text](/images/docs/<topic>/screenshot.png)
```

- For captions or styled frames, use minimal HTML (rehype-raw enabled):

```html
<figure>
  <img src="/images/docs/<topic>/screenshot.png" alt="Describe what’s visible and why it matters" />
  <figcaption>Optional context/caption for the screenshot.</figcaption>
  <!-- Keep HTML minimal; avoid inline styles when possible. -->
  <!-- Prefer PNG/SVG for crispness; optimize large PNGs. -->
  <!-- Consider adding a second crop focusing on the key UI element. -->
  <!-- Keep width under ~1400px; file size < 1 MB where possible. -->
  <!-- Never include secrets or PII in screenshots. -->
  <!-- Blur identifiers if necessary. -->
</figure>
```

---

## Videos and GIFs
- Place short clips under `/public/videos/**` or use GIFs under `/public/images/**`.
- Embed with HTML `<video>` for MP4 (autoplay disabled by default):

```html
<video src="/videos/demo.mp4" controls playsinline>
  Sorry, your browser doesn’t support embedded videos.
</video>
```

- Keep clips short (< 20s) and small (< 10 MB) where possible. Always provide context in surrounding text.

---

## Callouts (Notes, Tips, Warnings)
Preferred: MDX `<Callout type="note|tip|warning" title="...">`.

```markdown
> **Note:** This feature requires organization-level permissions.
> Additional context can be placed on the next line.

> **Tip:** Use `planton --help` to discover available subcommands.

> **Warning:** Rotating credentials will interrupt currently running jobs.

MDX Callout:

```mdx
<Callout type="warning" title="Credential rotation">
Rotating credentials will interrupt currently running jobs.
</Callout>
```
```

---

## Checklists and Steps
- Use ordered lists for steps and task flows.
- Use GFM checklists for to-dos.

```markdown
1. Open the service repository
2. Add the workflow file
3. Commit and push to trigger CI

- [ ] Configure credentials
- [ ] Set environment variables
- [ ] Validate deployment
```

---

## Code Blocks and Snippets
- Always add a language tag for syntax highlighting (highlight.js).
- Prefer realistic, copy-pastable examples.
- Use placeholders in angle brackets and document them (e.g., `<org-id>`).

```bash
# Install
brew install planton

# Authenticate
planton auth login --org <org-id>

# Deploy
planton deploy --env dev
```

Supported examples: `bash`, `yaml`, `json`, `ts`, `tsx`, `js`, `go`, `java`, `proto`, `hcl`, `dockerfile`, `sql`, `diff`, `text`.

Multi-file or directory trees:

```text
repo/
├─ .github/workflows/deploy.yml
├─ kustomize/
│  ├─ base/
│  └─ overlays/prod/
└─ src/
```

Diffs:

```diff
- replicas: 1
+ replicas: 3
```

Environment variables/secrets (redacted):

```bash
export SENDGRID_API_KEY="<redacted>"
```

---

## Tabs and Collapsible Sections (MDX + non-MDX)
Preferred: MDX components are available for tabs and lightweight UI. Fallback patterns also supported.

- MDX Tabs:

```mdx
<Tabs>
  <Tab label="CLI">
    ```bash
    planton deploy --env dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Console">
    Steps to deploy from the web console.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

- Collapsible details (fallback without MDX):

```html
<details>
  <summary>Show Kubernetes example</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...
```

</details>
```

- Language variants: present as adjacent H3s (e.g., “Using CLI”, “Using Console”).

---

## Cards and Grids (MDX + Markdown)
Preferred: MDX components for simple cards and grids. Fallback: lists/tables.

```markdown
| Resource | Description |
|---|---|
| [CLI Guide](/docs/cli) | Install and use the CLI |
| [Service Hub](/docs/service-hub) | Manage services and deployments |
```

Or minimal HTML (works with our renderer):

```html
<div>
  <div>
    <p><strong><a href="/docs/cli">CLI Guide</a></strong><br/>Install and use the CLI</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><strong><a href="/docs/service-hub">Service Hub</a></strong><br/>Manage services and deployments</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Keep HTML minimal; avoid framework-specific classes.

MDX Cards:

```mdx
<Cards columns={2}>
  <Card title="CLI Guide">Install and use the CLI</Card>
  <Card title="Service Hub">Manage services and deployments</Card>
</Cards>
```

---

## Diagrams
- Preferred: export diagrams to PNG/SVG and embed as images with alt text.
- If Mermaid or GraphViz source is helpful for readers, include it in a fenced code block below the image (for reference), but note it won’t render as a diagram in-page.

```markdown
![High-level architecture](/images/docs/overview/architecture.svg)

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Dev] -->|push| B[Pipeline];
  B --> C[Deploy];
```
```

---

## “Visuals” and “Asset Requests” Pattern
When a flow benefits from design-led visuals, include a short “Visuals” subsection listing suggested screenshots, diagrams, or clips. This mirrors the effective pattern used across `@docs-references` content.

```markdown
### Visuals
- Screenshot: Service Hub list with filters applied
- Diagram: Deploy pipeline from commit to environment
- Clip (≤15s): Real-time log tail with success state
```

---

## Links and Cross-References
- Use relative links for internal docs (e.g., `/docs/service-hub/deployments`).
- Use precise anchor links for headings when helpful.
- For code references, mention the path in backticks (e.g., ``planton-cloud/backend/services/service-hub``) and optionally link to GitHub.

---

## Asset Hygiene
- Optimize images (lossless for SVG, lossless/lossy for PNG/JPG as appropriate).
- Prefer SVG for UI diagrams; PNG for UI screenshots; GIF/MP4 for micro-interactions.
- Filenames: kebab-case, meaningful, no spaces.
- Remove obsolete assets when pages are deleted.

---

## Don’ts
- Don’t rely on MDX-only components (`<Tabs/>`, `<Card/>`, etc.) — not supported by our docs renderer yet.
- Don’t embed remote images or videos; keep assets local.
- Don’t include secrets, tokens, or PII in code, screenshots, or logs.
- Don’t use marketing superlatives in docs; keep it clear and task-focused (see `@docs-style`).

---

## Pre-Publish Checklist
- [ ] Style: Page follows `@docs-style` (voice, IA, frontmatter)
- [ ] Sources: Claims mapped to code/README per `@docs-sources`
- [ ] Assets: Local, optimized, with alt text and captions as needed
- [ ] Examples: Copy-pastable and tested
- [ ] Links: Relative for internal, correct anchors
- [ ] Skimmability: Headings, lists, visuals; no walls of text

---

## Example Section (ready-to-copy)

```markdown
## Deploy a service with Kustomize overlays

> **Tip:** Keep `base` minimal and override only what’s required per environment.

1. Create `kustomize/base/` and `kustomize/overlays/dev/` in your repo.
2. Set shared env via ConfigMaps; inject secrets via your provider’s secrets manager.
3. Commit and push to trigger CI.

```yaml
# kustomize/overlays/dev/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: payments
spec:
  replicas: 1
```

![Payments deployment overlays](/images/docs/deploy-services/overlays.png)

### Troubleshooting
> **Note:** If image tag isn’t updated, ensure the workflow passes the commit SHA via CLI flag.
