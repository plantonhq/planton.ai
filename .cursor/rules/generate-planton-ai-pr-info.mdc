# Rule: Pull Request Title and Description (ask-only)

Purpose: When asked to write a PR title and PR description, respond with exactly two copyable code blocks — first the title, then the description — without making any repository changes.

This rule is designed for ask mode only. Do not modify files, run commands, or propose edits. Output only the two fenced code blocks described below.

Usage: In Ask mode, invoke explicitly as `@pr-info`.

## How to respond (strict)
1) First block: PR Title
   - Fenced code block with language: `text`
   - Single line only
   - Prefix using Conventional Commits: one of `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `chore`, `revert`
   - Scope is required and must be planton.ai-aware, using a path-like token derived from changed files (heuristics below)
   - Imperative mood, concise, ≤ 72 characters after the prefix
   - No trailing period

2) Second block: PR Description
   - Fenced code block with language: `markdown`
   - Use the following sections when applicable. Omit any that are not relevant.
     - "Summary": 1–3 sentences describing what this PR does in plain language
     - "Context": Why this change is needed (problem, bug, or goal)
     - "Changes": Bullet list of key changes; group by area if helpful
     - "Implementation notes": Important design decisions or trade-offs
     - "Breaking changes": Clearly call out any breaking behavior and migration steps
     - "Test plan": How this was verified (tests, manual steps, screenshots/links)
     - "Risks": Known risks or rollback plan
     - "Checklist": Markdown checkboxes for docs, tests, backward compatibility
     - Optionally include issue links like `Closes #123` when known

## Title format (exactly)

```text
<prefix>(<scope-path>): <concise, imperative title>
```

## planton.ai-aware scope heuristics

Determine the `<scope-path>` from the changed files. Use the most impacted area by lines changed; if multiple, see multi-area guidance below.

- Website app (Next.js application)
  - `src/app/**` → `website/app`
  - `src/lib/**` → `website/lib`
  - `public/**` → `website/public`
  - Root app configuration (e.g., `next.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`, `postcss.config.mjs`) → `website/config`

- Content sources
  - `public/docs/**` → `docs`
  - `public/blog/**` → `blog`
  - `workspace/**` (drafts, transcripts, internal content staging) → `content/workspace`

- Project meta and tooling
  - `.cursor/**` → `.cursor`
  - `Makefile`, `README.md`, repo-level workflows or scripts → `repo`

### Multi-area changes
- If changes span multiple areas within the same parent, use the shared parent:
  - `src/app` and `src/lib` → `website`
  - Multiple content sections under `public/docs/**` → `docs`
- If changes are broadly cross-cutting (≥3 unrelated parents), use `repo`.

## How to infer the title prefix
- `feat`: Adds a new capability, page, component, or content section
- `fix`: Corrects a bug or content error
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without user-visible behavior changes
- `docs`: Documentation-only changes (most `public/docs/**` or README updates)
- `test`: Tests only
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI pipeline/config changes
- `build`: Build system or dependency changes
- `chore`: Routine maintenance (formatting, small cleanups) not covered above
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit/PR

Prefer `feat` vs `refactor` based on whether user-facing capability is introduced. Prefer `fix` when the primary intent is to resolve a defect, even if some refactoring was required.

## Inputs to use when generating
- The full diff and edit history from this session
- Changed files and their paths to infer scope using the rules above
- Commit messages, branch name, or linked issues if available

If context is insufficient to infer details, choose the best effort scope from filenames and touched areas. Do not ask questions; still produce both blocks.

## Output blocks (exactly two, nothing else)

- <key change 3>

## Implementation notes
- <notable decision or trade-off>

## Breaking changes
- <explicitly list or state "None">

## Test plan
- <how verified>

## Risks
- <risks and rollback>

## Checklist
- [ ] Docs updated (if needed)

## Examples

### Example 1: Landing Page Update

**Title:**
```text
feat(website/landing): add security badges to hero section
```

**Description:**
```markdown
## Summary

Added SOC 2, HIPAA, and customer-hosted deployment badges to the landing page hero section to emphasize security capabilities for healthcare and fintech prospects.

## Context

Advisory feedback indicated that healthcare vertical prospects need upfront security messaging. Current hero section doesn't address compliance concerns prominently.

## Changes

- Added security badge array to HeroSection component
- Created Badge component for trust indicators
- Updated hero layout to accommodate badges
- Added responsive styling for mobile

## Implementation notes

- Badges use SVG icons from design system
- Conditional rendering based on certification status
- Mobile layout stacks badges vertically

## Breaking changes

None

## Test plan

- Tested on desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Tested on mobile (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
- Verified responsive breakpoints
- Screenshots attached in PR

## Risks

Low risk - additive change to existing component

## Checklist

- [x] Docs updated (if needed)
- [x] Tests added/updated (if needed)
- [x] Backward compatible
```

### Example 2: Multi-area Content Update

**Title:**
```text
content(website): update copywriting across landing and pricing pages
```

**Description:**
```markdown
## Summary

Updated messaging across landing page and pricing page to reflect DevOps-in-a-Box positioning based on customer feedback and competitive analysis.

## Context

Customer interviews and advisory session revealed messaging gaps. Current copy emphasizes AI copilot (pivoted away from) vs infrastructure automation (actual product value).

## Changes

- Landing page: Updated hero, problem/solution, customer stories
- Pricing page: Clarified usage metering, added enterprise tier
- Consistent terminology across both pages
- Real customer metrics (iorta TechNext, Tynybay)

## Implementation notes

- Content changes only, no component structure modifications
- Followed @general-writing-guidelines for consistency
- Customer names and metrics verified with sales team

## Breaking changes

None - URLs and page structure unchanged

## Test plan

- Content reviewed by advisory board
- Copywriting validated against brand guidelines
- All links and CTAs verified functional
- Build passes without errors

## Risks

None - content-only changes

## Checklist

- [x] Docs updated (if needed)
- [ ] Tests added/updated (if needed)
- [x] Backward compatible

Closes #156
```

**Remember**: This is an ask-only rule. Output exactly two code blocks (title + description), nothing else. No file modifications, no commands.
