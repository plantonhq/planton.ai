   - 1 user documented: Harsha CH (Solo Developer)
   - First user, Infra Charts pioneer
   - Complete 6-day onboarding journey captured

**Value**: Future conversations can reference these files for instant customer context.

---

### Phase 2: Landing Page Copywriting Updates ✅

#### A. Hero Section
**Headline** (User's Choice):
```
What if DevOps Didn't Block Your Developers?
```
✅ Leads with pain point that resonates deeply  
✅ Question format makes readers reflect on current bottleneck

#### B. Six New Sections Added
1. **Social Proof Bar** - Customer logos (Jai.CX, TynyBay, iorta TechNext, Odwen) + metrics
2. **Security Trust Bar** - Compliance badges moved high on page
3. **How It Works** - 3-step visual before features
4. **Comparison Table (IaC)** - vs Terraform Cloud, Pulumi Cloud, Manual DevOps
5. **Comparison Table (PaaS)** - vs Vercel, Heroku, Render, Railway (NEW)
6. **Wall of Love** - 5 authentic customer testimonials

#### C. Eight Existing Sections Enhanced
1. **Infra Hub** - More proof points, GitHub links, **120+** deployment components (updated from 50+)
2. **Service Hub** - Pipeline visualization, enhanced quotes
3. **Customer Stories** - 3 detailed authentic stories (Harsha, TynyBay, iorta TechNext)
4. **ROI Calculator** - Interactive cost savings calculator (NEW interactive element)
5. **Pricing** - Early adopter pricing urgency element
6. **Open Standards** - Strengthened messaging
7. **Open Source Foundation** - "Open Infrastructure Modules—Not a Black Box" positioning
8. **Agent Fleet** - Added full SDLC context competitive advantage
9. **Final CTA** - 5 customer quote carousel

---

### Phase 3: Competitive Positioning Refinements ✅

#### A. Open Source: 3-Part Precision

**Clarified**:
- ✅ CLI tools: All 3 are open source (terraform, pulumi, project-planton)
- ❌ SaaS platforms: None are open source (Terraform Cloud, Pulumi Cloud, Planton Cloud)
- ✅ **Deployment modules: ONLY Planton** (120+ components on GitHub)

**Key Differentiator**: 
> "With Terraform/Pulumi Cloud, you write infrastructure modules yourself. With Planton, 120+ modules are built, maintained, and auditable by the community."

#### B. Out-of-the-Box: Updated to 120+

**Changed Throughout**:
- 50+ deployment components → **120+ deployment components**
- Shows significant platform maturity (2.5x original count)
- Comprehensive coverage (AWS, GCP, Azure, databases, queues, networking, etc.)

#### C. AI Agents: Full SDLC Context

**Acknowledged**: Pulumi has AI (Pulumi AI) - doing good work  
**Differentiated**: Planton agents understand full SDLC (Infra Hub + ServiceHub) vs. Pulumi's infra-only scope

**Key Advantage**:
> "Planton agents have extended context: infrastructure + services + pipelines + deployment history. Makes them far more capable for end-to-end troubleshooting."

#### D. PaaS Comparison Added (CRITICAL)

**New Comparison Section**: Planton vs Vercel, Heroku, Render, Railway

**Positioning**:
```
Planton = Vercel/Heroku DX + Terraform/Pulumi Infrastructure + YOUR Cloud
```

**Key Differentiator**:
> "You get Vercel's developer experience without giving up infrastructure control or getting locked into their platform."

---

### Phase 4: Testimonial Refinements ✅

#### Rakesh Kandhi (TynyBay Senior Developer)

**Removed**: Technical feature mention (`.files feature`)  
**Focus**: Self-service outcome and productivity

**Final Version**:
> "I can now update service configurations and deploy to dev, staging, and prod—all without waiting on DevOps. Self-service infrastructure through ServiceHub is a game changer for productivity."

#### Sai Saketh (iorta TechNext Junior DevOps)

**Removed**: 
1. Personal statement about lack of experience ("almost no AWS experience")
2. Cost savings mention ($144K/year) - ICs don't talk about budgets

**Final Version**:
> "Planton enabled me to provide a mature developer experience to our 7-person team without requiring deep AWS expertise. They deploy to multiple environments independently and manage the entire infrastructure lifecycle themselves."

**Why**: Empowering, professional, appropriate for IC perspective
