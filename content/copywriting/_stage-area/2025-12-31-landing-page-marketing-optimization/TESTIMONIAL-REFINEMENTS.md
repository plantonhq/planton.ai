# Testimonial Refinements

**Date**: December 31, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Rakesh Kandhi Testimonial - Removed Feature-Specific Mention ✅

**BEFORE**:
> "The .files feature in ServiceHub changed everything. I update service configs and deploy to dev, staging, prod—all without waiting on DevOps. Self-service infrastructure is a game changer."

**AFTER**:
> "I can now update service configurations and deploy to dev, staging, and prod—all without waiting on DevOps. Self-service infrastructure through ServiceHub is a game changer for productivity."

**Why Changed**:
- Removed `.files feature` specific technical detail
- Focused on outcome (self-service capability) not implementation detail
- More accessible to non-technical readers
- Maintains the core message (self-service, no DevOps waiting)

**Updated In**:
- ✅ Wall of Love (Card 4)
- ✅ Customer Stories section (Story 2 - TynyBay)
- ✅ Final CTA Carousel (Slide 4)
- ✅ Preview HTML (all instances)

### 2. Sai Saketh Testimonial - Reworded for Sensitivity ✅

**BEFORE**:
> "As a junior DevOps with almost no AWS experience, Planton enabled me to provide mature developer experience to our 7-person team. They deploy to multiple environments without me dealing with AWS complexity. Saves us $144K/year vs. senior hire."

**AFTER** (Final Version):
> "Planton enabled me to provide a mature developer experience to our 7-person team without requiring deep AWS expertise. They deploy to multiple environments independently and manage the entire infrastructure lifecycle themselves."

**Why Changed**:
- Removed personal statement "almost no AWS experience" (potentially embarrassing)
- Reframed as platform advantage "without requiring deep AWS expertise" (empowering)
- Removed cost savings mention ($144K/year) - individual contributors don't naturally talk about budgets
- Made it about the platform enabling teams, not about individual's skill gaps or company finances
- Focuses on professional outcomes (mature dev experience, team independence)
- More diplomatic and appropriate for IC testimonial

**Also Updated "Before Planton" Section**:

**BEFORE**:
```
• Junior DevOps engineer with almost no AWS experience
```

**AFTER**:
```
• Team lacked deep AWS expertise
```

**Why**: Shifts focus from individual's limitations to team capability gap (less personal)

**Updated In**:
- ✅ Wall of Love (Card 5)
- ✅ Customer Stories section (Story 3 - iorta TechNext)
  - Before Planton bullet point
  - Quote section
- ✅ Final CTA Carousel (Slide 5)
- ✅ Preview HTML (all instances)

## Key Messaging Preserved

### Rakesh's Core Value Prop ✅
- Self-service configuration updates
- Multi-environment deployment (dev, staging, prod)
- No waiting on DevOps
- Productivity transformation

### Sai's Core Value Prop ✅
- Junior DevOps providing senior-level outcomes
- Team doesn't need deep AWS expertise to succeed
- 7 developers deploying independently
- Complete infrastructure lifecycle management by dev team
- Platform enables success regardless of team's AWS depth

**Note**: Cost savings ($144,600/year) are mentioned in Customer Stories Key Metrics section (narrator voice), not in Sai's testimonial. Individual contributors don't naturally talk about budgets—that's a management concern.

**After**: Testimonials focus on positive outcomes and platform capabilities

**Readability**:

### 3. Sai Saketh Testimonial - Removed Cost Savings ✅

**Additional Refinement** (December 31, 2025):

**BEFORE** (Second Version):
> "...They deploy to multiple environments independently. Saves us $144K/year vs. hiring a senior DevOps engineer."

**AFTER** (Final Version):
> "...They deploy to multiple environments independently and manage the entire infrastructure lifecycle themselves."

**Why Changed**:
- Removed cost savings mention ($144K/year)
- Individual contributors (ICs) don't naturally talk about budget/salary comparisons
- Cost savings is a management concern (CEO, CTO), not IC perspective
- Keeps testimonial authentic to Sai's actual experience and role
- Cost savings still mentioned in Customer Stories Key Metrics section (narrator voice)

**Updated In**:
- ✅ Wall of Love (Card 5) - Final sentence
- ✅ Customer Stories section (Story 3 - Quote) - Extended quote adds "platform handles complexity"
- ✅ Final CTA Carousel (Slide 5) - Shorter version
- ✅ Preview HTML (Wall of Love)

---

**These refinements ensure testimonials are empowering, professional, authentic to each person's role, and focused on platform capabilities rather than individual limitations or inappropriate financial concerns.**
