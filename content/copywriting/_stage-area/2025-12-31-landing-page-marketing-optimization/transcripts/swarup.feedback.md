Unfortunately, I don't have a full list of names from all the clients at the moment, and Swarup Donepudi is me, the founder of Planton, so we don't want to use that one. I actually have a few names though. 

Harsha CH - Solo Developer on https://jai.cx/  team - Harsha was the first user of the platform who played a pivotal role in identifying infra charts. So he was the first user who filled form by form and provided critical feedback which changed the game and is probably the favorite feature of all the customers who came after that. So I don't know how you want to craft his testimonial, but I think I will have his approval to add his role and I can also get his image. 

Rohit Reddy Gopu is the CEO of TynyBay - and he has been championing Planton everywhere and he is very bullish on the platform and he wants to use Planton for all future client projects. He said it in his own words with me.  He also told me that for one of his client projects, because their DevOps engineer doesn't have GCP experience, but the client wanted to use GCP, Planton allowed him to be successful even without the DevOps engineer with GCP experience on his team. So, Planton fully gave him the entire DevOps for that client.  I have full approval from him to use his image and whatever testimonial that we would like to write. 

Balaji Borra - he is the only DevOps engineer of TynyBay. And Planton helped him handle multiple client projects all without having to deal with the grunt work of rewriting the entire Terraform between client projects. So overall his feedback is that his efficiency has improved and he is able to provide far better experience for all his developers with the help of Planton as a platform. And I do have his full approval, and I can get his image as well. 

Rakesh Kandhi - he is a senior developer on TynyBay, and he told me that the.files feature built into Planton's ServiceHub enabled him to update the configuration for services without having to interact with Balaji every time. So, we don't have to cross-reference names in the testimonial, but basically, it enables self-service DevOps for Rakesh and more importantly, whenever he needed to create new services, now it is completely self-service because he knows how to create new services or deploy services into multiple environments all without having to talk to their DevOps. And I have his full permission to use his testimonial, and I can get his image as well. 

For now, let's add these because these are pretty authoritative. We can also add another one who works for IOTA Tech and the next SalesVerse team as a Junio DevOps engineer - Sai Saketh - and it enabled him to help their dev team. He's a junior DevOps engineer, and it enabled him to provide a very mature developer experience to all their developers, helping them quickly deploy services into multiple environments without having to deal with rewriting, learning, upskilling himself, and dealing with all the complexities of AWS. He had almost no experience on AWS himself. Yeah, he too likes our platform and definitely will not have any problems with us using this testimonial. I can probably get his image as well. 

I just realized that so far I've not been capturing anything about our customers. And please write up. @planton-cloud/_business/customers/tynybay/README.md @planton-cloud/_business/customers/iorta-tech-next/README.md 
 because this is an internal node, we can create a section for primary users at these customers. Do not speculate; just write add only the content that you know for absolutely for sure based on whatever I provided you. 

and I captured Harsha's experience when I was first onboarding him and @planton-cloud/websites/kb.planton.cloud/content/customers Back then, they were called D33, which they leter re-branded as Jai.CX.

first, let's focus on capturing all of this valuable customer information in these files so that in future conversations, I can simply drag whenever I need to provide context about the customers and the actual end-users using the platform.

 also Rohit, who runs TynyBay for whom Technext was a client. I asked him once as to what is what according to him is the value proposition that he sees is that given Technext is in a regulated industry and given the fact that they do not have strong DevOps base, the fact that Planton as a platform provides a more mature infrastructure out of the box which covers a lot of compliance concerns. That was one of the value propositions, according to him.

and you can find the URLs and links for all these companies that I mentioned in the previous work that we did, which is captured in @planton.ai/content/copywriting/_stage-area/2025-12-19-landing-page-revamp-devops-in-a-box-positioning let me know if any of the information is not fully available from this context and the previous stage area. I'll get you that information 


Also, I am pretty sure that Pulumi is actually doing a good work in the AI integrations, but the fact that Pulumi is only an infrastructure platform and is not a full DevOps end-to-end solution means the AI is only effective for managing the infrastructure, whereas the agents that we are building help with the entire or are going to be more capable because they are going to be aware of the entire SdLC tooling and because of the extended context that Planton as a platform has because it's not just an infra platform, it is also a service delivery platform. So that additional extended platform makes the agents far more effective. 

And also Terraform and Pulumi are open source. In fact, they are more open source than Planton for sure. But yeah, so it's open source. We all three check those boxes. But Terraform and Pulumi are more like underlying, under the nuts and bolts, whereas Planton provides something that can be used out of the box. Even for people who are going to use Terraform and Pulumi cloud, they still need to write the modules that actually deploy their infrastructure. Pulumi is doing some efforts to provide out-of-the-box experiences, but nothing like what Planton provides. It's far more out-of-the-box experience than what Pulumi provides, and I don't think Terraform even has that concept. 

Again, it is very important to understand the difference between Terraform and Pulumi which are CLIs and they are open source. But it's Terraform cloud and Pulumi cloud, their SaaS offerings, those are not open source. Similarly in Planton, Planton as a platform is not open source. But the underlying all the infrastructure modules that deploy the actual customers infrastructure, everything is open source. 

And we actually want to compare it with ServiceHub and Heroku as well because Vercel and Heroku provide similar deployment experiences. Vercel provides out-of-the-box deployment for only Next.js projects and does not give you control over the infrastructure, whereas Planton provides. Vercel provides a great developer experience without having to write any Terraform, without having to write anything like GitHub Actions or Jenkins files or GitLab CI pipelines. It still provides out-of-the-box automation that takes your code, builds it, and deploys it and provides a URL, but comes with caveats of no control over infrastructure or customization. It more importantly doesn't do anything outside of Next.js, and platforms like Heroku and Render. Heroku doesn't give you control over your infrastructure, and so does Render, I guess. That's the biggest difference. Both Heroku, Render, Railway etc they provide an ability to deploy backend services, but have little support for infrastructure deployments. Obviously Vercel doesn't do anything related to infrastructure automation; it is focused on service-only. So those are other competitors that I can think of.
