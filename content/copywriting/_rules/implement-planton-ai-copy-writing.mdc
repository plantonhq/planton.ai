# Rule: Implement Planton.ai Copywriting

**Type**: Action Rule (Implementation-Focused LLM)  
**Purpose**: Implement approved copywriting changes by updating React components in the planton.ai website based on handoff documents from the copywriting phase.

**Architecture**: This is the **second phase** of the two-LLM copywriting workflow:
- **Phase 1** (Copywriting LLM): Content creation → handoff.md
- **Phase 2** (This Rule): handoff.md → React component updates

## 🎯 Your Role: Implementation Expert

**You are the code specialist.** Your expertise:
- React component architecture and patterns
- TypeScript types and interfaces
- Material-UI component library
- Design systems and consistency
- Responsive layouts and accessibility
- Build systems and deployment

**The handoff document provides**:
- Context (why changes are needed)
- Objectives (what outcome to achieve)
- References (where to find approved content)
- Guidance (key messages, priorities)

**The handoff document does NOT provide**:
- Code snippets or examples
- Implementation instructions
- Technical prescriptions
- Specific components to use

**Your job**:
1. **Analyze existing codebase** in `src/` directories
2. **Read approved content** in `draft-N.md` and `preview-N.html`
3. **Determine best implementation approach**
4. **Update components** using your expertise
5. **Verify** everything works correctly

**Trust yourself**. The handoff gives you context and objectives. Implementation decisions are yours.

---

## When to Use This Rule

Trigger this rule when:
- You've received a `handoff.md` file from the copywriting phase
- The copywriting LLM has completed draft approval and handoff creation
- You're ready to implement approved content changes to the website
- You need to update React components in `src/` based on approved copy

## Prerequisites

Before triggering this rule:

1. **Obtain stage folder**: Get the complete stage folder from copywriting phase
   - Location: `content/copywriting/_stage-area/YYYY-MM-DD-description/`
   - Contains: `handoff.md` (context), `draft-N.md` (approved content), `preview-N.html` (visual)

2. **Read materials in order**:
   - **First**: `handoff.md` - Understand context and objectives
   - **Second**: `draft-N.md` - Get approved copy
   - **Third**: `preview-N.html` - See visual representation
   - **Then**: Analyze `src/` components to determine implementation

3. **Ensure repository state**: Make sure you're in the planton.ai workspace
   - Working directory: `/Users/swarup/scm/github.com/plantoncloud/planton.ai`
   - Clean working tree (no conflicting uncommitted changes)

## Phase 1: Understanding

### Read Handoff Document

1. **Locate handoff.md** in the provided stage folder

2. **Read completely** to understand:
   - **Overview**: What's being implemented
   - **Objective**: Clear implementation goal
   - **Historical Context**: Where feedback came from, iteration journey
   - **What Was Approved**: References to draft-N.md and preview-N.html
   - **Component Mapping**: Which files to update (paths only)
   - **Content Guidance**: Key messages, tone, priorities
   - **Business Objectives**: Why this matters
   - **Verification Expectations**: How success is measured

3. **Read approved materials** (for actual content):
   - **`draft-N.md`**: Complete approved copy with all sections (primary reference)
   - **`preview-N.html`**: Visual representation showing layout and hierarchy

4. **Analyze existing codebase**:
   - **Read component files** listed in mapping table
   - **Understand current structure**: TypeScript types, MUI usage, patterns
   - **Review design system**: `src/components/landing-page-v2/shared.tsx`
   - **Identify update strategy**: How to apply approved content

## 🎯 IMPORTANT: You Are the Implementation Expert

**The handoff provides context, NOT code instructions.**

**Your expertise**:
- Analyzing React component architecture
- Understanding TypeScript patterns
- Applying design systems correctly
- Choosing appropriate MUI components
- Structuring code optimally

**Use the handoff for**:
- Understanding why changes are needed
- Knowing which files to update
- Getting business context
- Finding approved content (in draft-N.md)

**Figure out yourself**:
- How to implement the changes
- Which components/patterns to use
- Code structure and organization
- Technical implementation details

**Don't expect**:
- Code snippets in handoff
- Line-by-line instructions
- Specific components prescribed
- Technical implementation details

**The handoff trusts your expertise**. Analyze the codebase and implement changes using your best judgment.

### Extract Key Information

From `handoff.md`, extract:

**Context and Objectives**:
- Historical context (where feedback came from)
- Iteration journey (what drafts were created, why)
- Business objectives (why this change matters)
- Target audience impact

**Target Information**:
- Page(s) being updated (landing, pricing, features, etc.)
- Sections being modified (hero, problem/solution, customer stories, etc.)
- Scope (single component vs multiple components)

**Component Mapping**:
- List of files to update (paths only - handoff provides no code)
- You'll analyze each file to understand structure

**Content References**:
- Location of approved content: `draft-N.md`
- Visual guide: `preview-N.html`
- You'll read these to understand what content to apply

**Content Guidance**:
- Key messages to emphasize
- Tone and voice
- Content priorities

### Analyze the Codebase

**After reading handoff**, analyze existing code:

1. **Read component files** listed in mapping:
   ```bash
   # Example
   src/components/landing-page-v2/HeroSection.tsx
   src/components/landing-page-v2/CustomerStories.tsx
   ```

2. **Understand current structure**:
   - Component architecture (functional components, hooks)
   - TypeScript interfaces and types
   - MUI components used (Box, Stack, Grid2, Typography)
   - Design system imports (from shared.tsx)
   - Data structures (arrays, objects)
   - Responsive layouts

3. **Read design system**:
   ```bash
   src/components/landing-page-v2/shared.tsx
   ```
   - Available components (Section, Card, Badge, Button, etc.)
   - Color system and gradients
   - Typography scale
   - Layout patterns

4. **Read approved content**:
   ```bash
   # From stage folder
   draft-N.md      # Complete approved copy
   preview-N.html  # Visual representation
   ```

**Now you know**:
- What needs to change (from handoff context)
- What the approved content is (from draft-N.md)
- How the current code is structured (from analyzing src/)
- What tools are available (from design system)

**Determine implementation strategy** based on this analysis.

Proceeding to create detailed implementation plan...
```

**Note**: Your implementation plan is based on YOUR analysis of the codebase, not prescribed by the handoff. The handoff provides context; you provide the technical solution.

## Phase 2: Planning

### Analyze Current Components

**This is YOUR phase as the implementation expert.** Analyze the codebase to determine the best implementation approach.

For each component in the mapping table:

1. **Read current component file** thoroughly
2. **Identify structure**:
   - Component type (functional component)
   - Props interface
   - State management (hooks, context)
   - MUI components used (Box, Stack, Grid2, Typography)
   - Design system imports from `shared.tsx`
3. **Locate content sections**:
   - Where headlines are defined (SectionTitle, Typography, etc.)
   - Where body text lives (BodyText, Typography)
   - How lists/bullets are structured (ul/li, array mapping)
   - CTA button configuration (PrimaryButton, SecondaryButton)
   - Customer data structures (arrays of objects)
4. **Note dependencies**:
   - Import statements (what's already imported)
   - Design system usage (which shared components are used)
   - Image/asset references (logo paths, etc.)
5. **Understand patterns**:
   - How similar content is currently structured
   - Naming conventions used
   - TypeScript typing patterns
   - Responsive layout approach

### Read Approved Content

From stage folder:

1. **Read `draft-N.md`**: Get exact approved copy for all sections
2. **Read `preview-N.html`**: Understand visual hierarchy and layout
3. **Compare with current code**: Identify what needs to change

### Determine Implementation Approach

**Based on your analysis**, decide:

- How to update each component
- Which design system components to use
- How to structure new content
- TypeScript types needed (if any)
- Responsive layout adjustments

**Remember**: The handoff doesn't prescribe implementation. YOU determine the best approach based on analyzing existing code.

### Create Implementation Plan

Generate a detailed, actionable plan based on YOUR analysis:

```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Overview
[Brief description of what will be changed]

### Component 1: [ComponentName]

**File**: src/components/landing-page-v2/HeroSection.tsx

**Current State**:
- Headline: "DevOps-in-a-Box—From Code to Cloud in Under an Hour"
- Subheadline: [current text]
- CTAs: [current buttons]

**Changes Required**:
1. Update headline (line 42):
   - From: "DevOps-in-a-Box—From Code to Cloud in Under an Hour"
   - To: "Deploy Production Infrastructure in Minutes, Not Weeks"

2. Update subheadline (lines 45-47):
   - Add quantified social proof
   - Include customer metrics

3. Add security badges (new section after line 60):
   - Create badge array
   - Map to Badge component from shared.tsx

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before
<SectionTitle>
  DevOps-in-a-Box—From Code to Cloud in Under an Hour
</SectionTitle>

// After
<SectionTitle>
  Deploy Production Infrastructure in Minutes, Not Weeks
</SectionTitle>
```

**Complexity**: Low (content updates only, no structural changes)

---

### Component 2: [ComponentName]

[Repeat structure for each component]

---

### New Components (if any)

[Document any new components that need to be created]

---

### Design System Usage

**Imports Required**:
```typescript
import {
  Section,
  SectionTitle,
  Badge,
  // ... other components
} from './shared';
```

**Colors**:
- Primary gradient: #7c3aed → #0ea5e9
- Accent green: #10b981
- Background: #0a0a0a variants

**Typography**:
- Section titles: 2.5rem, font-weight 700
- Feature titles: 1.5rem, font-weight 600
- Body text: 1.05rem, line-height 1.6

### Verification Plan

```

## Phase 3: Implementation

### Execute Component Updates

For each component in the plan:

1. **Read current component code**
2. **Make precise changes**:
   - Update text content
   - Modify badges/labels
   - Change metrics/numbers
   - Update customer quotes
   - Adjust CTAs
3. **Preserve everything else**:
   - TypeScript types and interfaces
   - MUI component structure
   - Event handlers
   - Responsive props
   - Design system imports
   - Code formatting and style

### Implementation Principles

**Preserve Structure**:
- Keep component architecture intact
- Maintain TypeScript typing
- Don't modify prop interfaces unless required
- Keep event handlers and logic unchanged
- Preserve responsive layouts

**Update Content**:
- Replace text strings with approved copy
- Update numeric values (metrics, prices)
- Change badge/label text
- Modify customer quotes
- Update button text and links

**Maintain Consistency**:
- Use design system components from `shared.tsx`
- Follow existing patterns in component
- Keep color/typography variables
- Maintain spacing and layout structure

### Example: Hero Section Update

**File**: `src/components/landing-page-v2/HeroSection.tsx`

**Change 1: Headline**

Current:
```typescript
<SectionTitle>
  DevOps-in-a-Box—From Code to Cloud in Under an Hour
</SectionTitle>
```

Updated:
```typescript
<SectionTitle>
  Deploy Production Infrastructure in Minutes, Not Weeks
</SectionTitle>
```

**Change 2: Add Social Proof**

Insert after headline:
```typescript
<Box sx={{ mt: 2, mb: 3 }}>
  <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ color: '#10b981', fontSize: '1.1rem' }}>
    5 paying customers • 100% retention • <1 hour infrastructure deployment
  </Typography>
</Box>
```

**Change 3: Security Badges**

Add new badge section:
```typescript
const securityBadges = [
  { label: 'SOC 2 Type I', status: 'Q1 2026' },
  { label: 'HIPAA BAA Ready', status: 'Available' },
  { label: 'Customer-Hosted', status: 'Available' },
];

// In JSX
<Stack direction="row" spacing={2} sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
  {securityBadges.map((badge) => (
    <Badge key={badge.label} variant="success">
      {badge.label}
    </Badge>
  ))}
</Stack>
```

### Progress Reporting

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Update Patterns

**Reading Current Code**:
```typescript
// 1. Read the component file
// 2. Identify the section to update
// 3. Note the current structure and props
```

**Updating Text Content**:
```typescript
// Simple text update
<SectionTitle>
  New headline text here
</SectionTitle>

// Paragraph update
<BodyText>
  New paragraph text here. Maintain the tone and formatting.
</BodyText>

// List items
<ul>
  <li>New bullet point 1</li>
  <li>New bullet point 2</li>
  <li>New bullet point 3</li>
</ul>
```

**Adding New Elements**:
```typescript
// Import if needed
import { Badge, Quote, Metric } from './shared';

// Add new badge
<Badge variant="success">SOC 2 Type I</Badge>

// Add new quote
<Quote
  text="Customer quote here"
  author="Company Name"
  role="Title"
/>

// Add new metric
<Metric value="<1 hour" label="Infrastructure Deployment" />
```

**Updating Customer Stories**:
```typescript
const customerStories = [
  {
    company: 'Company Name',
    industry: 'IT Consulting',
    team: '3 people',
    result: 'Result description',
    quote: 'Customer quote',
    logo: '/images/customers/company-logo.svg',
  },
  // ... more stories
];
```

**Updating Metrics**:
```typescript
// Simple metric
<Typography variant="h3">$450/month</Typography>

// Comparison metric
<Box>
  <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">Before: $12,500/month</Typography>
  <Typography variant="h4" color="success.main">After: $450/month</Typography>
  <Typography variant="body1" color="success.light">96% cost reduction</Typography>
</Box>
```

### Design System Reference

**File**: `src/components/landing-page-v2/shared.tsx`

**Common Imports**:
```typescript
import {
  Section,           // Page section wrapper
  SectionTitle,      // Main section heading
  SectionSubtitle,   // Section subheading
  FeatureTitle,      // Feature heading
  BodyText,          // Body paragraph
  PrimaryButton,     // Primary CTA button
  SecondaryButton,   // Secondary CTA button
  Card,              // Card component
  Badge,             // Badge/label component
  Grid,              // Grid layout
  Quote,             // Customer quote
  Metric,            // Large metric display
} from './shared';
```

**Color System**:
```typescript
// Primary gradient
background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #7c3aed 0%, #0ea5e9 100%)'

// Accent green (success)
color: '#10b981'

// Background variants
background: '#0a0a0a'  // Primary dark
background: '#1a1a1a'  // Card background
background: '#2a2a2a'  // Border color
```

**Typography Scale**:
```typescript
// Section title
fontSize: '2.5rem', fontWeight: 700

// Feature title
fontSize: '1.5rem', fontWeight: 600

// Body text
fontSize: '1.05rem', lineHeight: 1.6

// Small text
fontSize: '0.9rem', color: '#888'
```

**Responsive Breakpoints** (MUI):
```typescript
// Grid2 responsive sizing
<Grid2 size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, lg: 3 }}>
  // xs: mobile (full width)
  // sm: tablet (2 columns)
  // lg: desktop (4 columns)
</Grid2>
```

### TypeScript Best Practices

**Preserve Types**:
```typescript
// Keep existing interface
interface ComponentProps {
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
}

// If adding new props, extend interface
interface ComponentProps {
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  badges?: Array<{ label: string; status: string }>;  // New
}
```

**Type Safety**:
```typescript
// Use proper types for arrays
const items: string[] = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3'];

// Use proper types for objects
const config: { key: string; value: number } = {
  key: 'example',
  value: 42,
};
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Fixes

**TypeScript Error: Cannot find name 'Badge'**:
```typescript
// Fix: Add import
import { Badge } from './shared';
```

**TypeScript Error: Property 'badges' does not exist on type 'Props'**:
```typescript
// Fix: Add to interface
interface ComponentProps {
  badges?: Array<{ label: string; status: string }>;
}
```

**Build Error: Module not found**:
```typescript
// Fix: Check import path
import { Component } from './shared';  // Correct
import { Component } from '../shared';  // Wrong path
```

**Runtime Error: Cannot read property of undefined**:
```typescript
// Fix: Add optional chaining or default
<Typography>{data?.title || 'Default Title'}</Typography>
```

### Build Troubleshooting

**Error**: "TypeScript compilation failed"
- **Fix**: Review TypeScript errors in output
- Check types, interfaces, imports
- Verify prop usage matches interfaces

**Error**: "Export 'Component' not found in 'shared'"
- **Fix**: Check shared.tsx exports
- Verify component name is correct
- Check if component exists in design system

**Error**: "Unexpected token"
- **Fix**: Syntax error in JSX
- Check for unclosed tags
- Verify bracket matching

```

### 2. Commit Changes

```bash
@commit-planton-ai-changes
# Creates conventional commit with proper message
```

### 3. Create Pull Request (Optional)

```bash
@create-planton-ai-pull-request
# Creates PR with title and description

## Best Practices

### Do:

- ✅ **Read handoff.md completely** before starting
- ✅ **Create implementation plan** before making changes
- ✅ **Test locally** after each component update
- ✅ **Verify build** before marking complete
- ✅ **Compare with preview.html** for visual accuracy
- ✅ **Preserve TypeScript types** and component structure
- ✅ **Use design system** components consistently
- ✅ **Report progress** as you update components

### Don't:

- ❌ **Skip the planning phase** - understand scope first
- ❌ **Make structural changes** unless specified in handoff
- ❌ **Modify component interfaces** unless necessary
- ❌ **Skip build verification** - catch errors early
- ❌ **Forget to clean workspace** - keep repository clean
- ❌ **Skip changelog creation** - document all changes
- ❌ **Guess at content** - use approved copy exactly

## Troubleshooting

### Handoff document unclear

**Problem**: Handoff instructions are ambiguous or incomplete.

**Solution**:
1. Review draft-N.md and preview-N.html for additional context
2. Check existing component code for patterns
3. Ask user for clarification with specific questions
4. Make best judgment based on design system patterns

### Component structure doesn't match handoff

**Problem**: Component code is different from what handoff describes.

**Solution**:
1. Component may have been refactored since handoff creation
2. Read current component code carefully
3. Adapt instructions to current structure
4. Maintain same changes (content updates) in new structure
5. Document discrepancy in implementation notes

### Build fails with unclear errors

**Problem**: Build errors are cryptic or hard to diagnose.

**Solution**:
1. Run `yarn dev` for more detailed error messages
2. Check browser console for runtime errors
3. Review recent changes - rollback and apply incrementally
4. Search error message for common solutions
5. Ask user for help if stuck

### Visual doesn't match preview

**Problem**: Updated website looks different from preview.html.

**Solution**:
1. Preview is approximation, not pixel-perfect
2. Focus on content accuracy (text, structure)
3. Design system may differ slightly from preview styles
4. If significantly different, consult user
5. Maintain existing design system patterns over preview appearance

## Advanced Scenarios

### Multi-Component Updates

When handoff involves many components:

1. **Group by page** (landing, pricing, etc.)
2. **Update in logical order** (top to bottom of page)
3. **Test after each component** to isolate issues
4. **Report progress** after each file

### New Component Creation

When handoff requires new components:

1. **Create file** in appropriate directory
2. **Follow existing patterns** from similar components
3. **Import design system** components
4. **Export from index.ts**
5. **Update page route** to include new component

**Example**:
```typescript
// src/components/landing-page-v2/NewSection.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Section, SectionTitle, BodyText } from './shared';

export const NewSection: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Section>
      <SectionTitle>New Section Title</SectionTitle>
      <BodyText>Section content here...</BodyText>
    </Section>
  );
};

// src/components/landing-page-v2/index.ts
export { NewSection } from './NewSection';

// src/app/(root)/page.tsx
import { NewSection } from '@/components/landing-page-v2';

// Add to page
<NewSection />
```

### Significant Layout Changes

When handoff involves layout restructuring:

1. **Understand new layout** from handoff and preview
2. **Modify Grid2 or Stack** layouts carefully
3. **Test responsive breakpoints** thoroughly
4. **Verify no layout breaks** on mobile
5. **Check hover states** and interactions
