---

## Section 3: Infra Hub

### Section Title
**Infra Hub: Infrastructure Deployment Without the Wait**

### Subtitle
Replaces Terraform Enterprise, Pulumi Cloud, and manual cloud console work

### Introduction Paragraph
Infra Hub turns infrastructure deployment from a multi-day marathon into a sub-hour sprint. Deploy individual components or complete environments with zero-configuration CI/CD, live progress visualization, and built-in best practices.

---

### Feature 1: Zero-Config CI/CD

**Headline:** Infrastructure Pipelines That Just Work

**Body Copy:**
No GitHub Actions to write. No Terraform state buckets to configure. No manual deployments through cloud consoles. Connect your cloud account and start deploying infrastructure through simple forms or CLI commands.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Live Terraform plan/apply visualization** - Watch your infrastructure come to life in real-time
- **5-10 minute deployments** vs days of manual cloud console work
- **Version history and rollback** - Every change tracked, easily reversible
- **Multi-cloud consistency** - Same workflow whether you're on AWS, GCP, or Azure

---

### Feature 2: Infra Charts: Complete Environments in One Form

**Headline:** Stop Assembling Lego Blocks—Deploy Complete Environments

**Body Copy:**
Deploying infrastructure piece-by-piece is tedious and error-prone. VPC first, then Route53, then ECR, then certificates, then load balancers... each waiting for the previous to complete. Infra Charts eliminate this pain.

**How It Works:**
Inspired by Kubernetes Helm Charts, Infra Charts bundle related infrastructure components into a single deployable unit. Fill out one form, click deploy, and the platform orchestrates everything in the correct order via DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).

**Example: AWS ECS Environment**
One Infra Chart deploys:
- VPC with proper subnets and routing
- Route53 DNS zone for your domain
- ECR container registry for images
- SSL/TLS certificates via Certificate Manager
- Application Load Balancer with listeners
- Security groups with proper ingress/egress rules

**The Platform Knows:**
- VPC must exist before load balancer (load balancers require VPC ID)
- Certificates must be validated before HTTPS listeners
- Security groups must allow traffic to backend services

**What This Means:**
You describe what you want. The platform figures out the how.

---

### Feature 3: Deployment Component Store

**Headline:** 20% of Cloud Services Used 80% of the Time—All Pre-Modeled

**Body Copy:**
Stop reinventing the wheel. Browse our carefully crafted deployment components for the most common cloud resources:

**AWS:** ECS, EKS, Lambda, RDS, S3, CloudFront, Route53, ALB, VPC, and more
**GCP:** Cloud Run, GKE, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, Cloud CDN, and more  
**Azure:** AKS, Azure Functions, Azure SQL, Storage Accounts, and more

**All Open Source:**
Every deployment component lives in the [Project Planton repository](https://github.com/project-planton/project-planton). Audit the exact Terraform and Pulumi code. Contribute improvements. No black boxes.

**Visual Direction:** Screenshot of Deployment Component Store browser showing categorized components by cloud provider

---

### Customer Proof Point

**Real Customer Result:**
"IOTA Technics deployed a complete GCP Cloud Run environment for their health insurance platform in under 1 hour—with 7 developers managing everything themselves. Previously, this would have required a dedicated DevOps engineer and taken a full day minimum."

---

## Section 4: Service Hub

### Section Title
**Service Hub: Vercel for Backend—In YOUR Cloud**

### Subtitle
Connect Git repo → Automatic pipelines → Multi-cloud deployment

### Introduction Paragraph
Vercel nailed the developer experience for frontend deployments. Service Hub brings that same magic to backend services—with one critical difference: everything runs in YOUR cloud account. You keep full infrastructure control and visibility.

---

### Feature 1: Git-to-Cloud in Minutes

**Headline:** From Repository to Running Service—Zero Configuration Required

**Body Copy:**
Connect your GitHub or GitLab repository. That's it. Every new commit automatically triggers a pipeline that builds your container image, pushes it to your registry, and deploys it to your target environment.

**No More:**
- ❌ Writing Dockerfiles (unless you want control—then it's optional)
- ❌ Configuring GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- ❌ Managing container registries manually
- ❌ Orchestrating deployments across environments

**You Get:**
- ✅ Automatic pipeline creation on every commit
- ✅ Built-in Docker image building and registry pushes
- ✅ Live logs and deployment progress
- ✅ Multi-environment support (dev, QA, staging, prod)

---

### Feature 2: Multi-Cloud Consistency

**Headline:** Same Developer Experience—Any Cloud, Any Target

**Body Copy:**
Deploy to AWS ECS, AWS EKS, GCP Cloud Run, Azure Container Instances, or Cloudflare Workers. The Service Hub experience stays identical. No vendor lock-in. No relearning workflows when you switch clouds.

**Supported Targets:**
- **AWS ECS** - Container services without Kubernetes complexity
- **AWS EKS** - Full Kubernetes power when you need it
- **GCP Cloud Run** - Serverless containers that scale to zero
- **Azure Cloud Functions** - Event-driven serverless compute
- **Cloudflare Workers** - Edge compute for global performance

**Why This Matters:**
Start on AWS ECS for simplicity. Migrate to GCP Cloud Run for cost optimization. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers for edge use cases. Same code, same platform, zero refactoring.

---

### Feature 3: Built-In CI/CD—No Jenkins, No GitHub Actions

**Headline:** Pipeline Management Without the Pipeline Management

**Body Copy:**
Jenkins requires dedicated infrastructure and constant maintenance. GitHub Actions requires YAML configuration gymnastics. Service Hub requires... a Git connection.

**How It Works:**
1. **Connect Repository** - One-time GitHub/GitLab OAuth
2. **Select Target** - Choose AWS ECS, GCP Cloud Run, or any supported platform
3. **Configure Service** - Environment variables, resource limits, scaling rules
4. **Deploy** - First deployment kicks off immediately

**From There:**
- Every commit triggers a new pipeline run
- Live logs stream in real-time
- Deployment status visible at a glance
- Failed builds? Logs tell you exactly why
- Rollback to previous version with one click

**What You Replace:**
Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, CircleCI, Travis CI—any CI/CD platform focused solely on building and deploying containerized services.

---

### Customer Quote

**"Developers self-onboard their own services. That's a huge win."**

## Section 5: Open Source Foundation

### Section Title
**Open Source Foundation: Your Infrastructure, Your Code, Your Freedom**

### Subtitle
Project Planton - All deployment components publicly available. No vendor lock-in, ever.

### Introduction Paragraph
Most DevOps platforms are black boxes. You trust them with your infrastructure, but you can't audit how they work. You're locked in—switching costs are prohibitive. Planton is different. Everything is transparent. Everything is portable. Your infrastructure, your rules.

---

### Pillar 1: Transparent Infrastructure

**Headline:** Audit Every Line of Infrastructure Code

**Body Copy:**
Every Terraform module and Pulumi component used by Planton lives in the public [Project Planton repository](https://github.com/project-planton/project-planton). Want to know exactly what IAM permissions the AWS ALB deployment requires? Read the code. Concerned about security groups? Audit the Terraform files yourself.

**What's Open Source:**
- All Terraform modules for every deployment component
- All Pulumi implementations (alternative IaC framework)
- CLI tools for local infrastructure management
- Deployment component schemas and validation rules

**Why This Matters:**
- **Security audits** - Your team or third-party auditors can verify everything
- **Compliance requirements** - Prove to regulators exactly what's deployed and how
- **Learning and contribution** - Understand best practices, contribute improvements
- **No surprises** - No hidden infrastructure, no mystery permissions

---

### Pillar 2: Built-In Exit Strategy

**Headline:** Outgrow Planton? Take Your Infrastructure With You

**Body Copy:**
Unlike proprietary platforms that trap you in their ecosystem, Planton is designed for portability. If you outgrow the platform, get acquired, or decide to hire an in-house DevOps team—your infrastructure investment comes with you.

**How It Works:**

**1. Export Your Configurations**
One API call exports all your infrastructure configurations as YAML manifests:
- All deployment component specs
- All environment configurations
- All service definitions
- Complete infrastructure-as-code

**2. Use the Open Source CLI**
The Project Planton CLI is independent of the proprietary platform. Install it anywhere:
```bash
brew install plantoncloud/tap/project-planton
```

**3. Manage Independently**
Continue managing your infrastructure using the same YAML manifests:
- Run `project-planton pulumi up` directly from your CI/CD
- Integrate with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins
- No platform dependency, no subscription required

**4. Gradual or Immediate Transition**
- **Overlap period:** Run Planton platform AND independent CLI simultaneously
- **Zero downtime:** Transition infrastructure management without production disruption
- **Support available:** We'll help you migrate successfully (Build, Operate, Transfer model)

---

### Pillar 3: Community & Contributions

**Headline:** Built By DevOps Engineers, For DevOps Engineers

**Body Copy:**
Project Planton isn't just open source—it's community-driven. Found a bug in a deployment component? Submit a PR. Need support for a new AWS service? Contribute the Terraform module. Want a better way to handle multi-region deployments? Open an issue, propose the design.

**Contribution Areas:**
- New deployment components for emerging cloud services
- Improved Terraform/Pulumi implementations
- Multi-cloud abstractions and compatibility
- Security and compliance enhancements
- Documentation and examples

---

### Why This Matters: The Vendor Lock-In Problem

**Most Platforms:**
- Proprietary infrastructure code you can't audit
- Custom workflows you can't replicate
- Migration costs measured in engineer-months
- "Trust us" security models

**Planton:**
- All code public and auditable
- Standard Terraform/Pulumi workflows
- Migration costs measured in hours
- "Verify, then trust" security model

**The Promise:**
Use Planton because it's the best platform for your needs—not because switching is too expensive.

## Section 6: Agent Fleet

### Section Title
**Agent Fleet: AI That Actually Works for DevOps**

### Subtitle
Specialized agents, not generic copilots. Deterministic outputs, not 80% accuracy.

### Introduction: The Copilot Experiment That Failed

**Honest Context:**
We spent 8 months building a generic AI copilot for DevOps. It hallucinated constantly. Customers were hesitant to use it for production because accuracy wasn't good enough. DevOps requires deterministic outputs—if you're creating or destroying a database, 80% accuracy isn't acceptable.

**The Pivot:**
We learned from Cursor. They proved AI can be deterministic when combined with specialized tooling, deep context, and narrow scope. We rebuilt our AI layer from scratch as "Agent Fleet"—specialized agents for specific DevOps tasks, not a one-size-fits-all chatbot.

---

### What Agent Fleet Is

**Not a Generic Copilot:**
Agent Fleet doesn't try to do everything. Each agent is specialized for a specific domain—pipeline troubleshooting, ECS debugging, Kubernetes diagnostics. Narrow scope = higher accuracy = production-ready.

**Agentic Architecture:**
These aren't chatbots with fancy prompts. They're agents with real capabilities:
- **Terminal access** - Run commands, inspect logs, analyze configurations
- **Repository operations** - Clone repos, read code, understand context
- **Cloud API integration** - Query AWS, GCP, Azure for real-time resource state
- **Platform awareness** - Full context of your Planton infrastructure and services

**Technology Under the Hood:**
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** - AWS MCP, GitHub MCP, Planton MCP
- **Specialized tooling** - Each agent has custom tools for its domain
- **Context-aware LLMs** - Agents understand your specific infrastructure, not generic examples

---

### Current Agents (Beta)

#### Agent 1: Pipeline Manager

**What It Does:**
Troubleshoots CI/CD pipeline failures—whether they're due to Docker build errors, deployment misconfigurations, or code issues.

**Capabilities:**
- Analyzes build logs to identify root cause
- Understands Tekton, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI configurations
- Can clone your repository to inspect Dockerfiles and code
- Suggests fixes based on actual errors, not generic advice

**Example Use Case:**
Your pipeline fails with "ERROR: failed to solve: process '/bin/sh -c npm install' did not complete successfully"

Pipeline Manager:
1. Reads the full build log
2. Identifies the specific npm dependency causing the issue
3. Checks your `package.json` for compatibility problems
4. Suggests the fix: update Node.js version or pin dependency version

---

#### Agent 2: ECS Troubleshooter

**What It Does:**
Debugs AWS ECS service issues—task failures, networking problems, resource constraints.

**Capabilities:**
- Integrates with AWS MCP server to query ECS task status
- Reads CloudWatch logs for your failed tasks
- Analyzes service event history
- Understands Planton service configurations and deployment history

**Example Use Case:**
Your ECS service shows "STOPPED (Essential container exited)" but you don't know why.

ECS Troubleshooter:
1. Queries ECS for task details via AWS API
2. Pulls CloudWatch logs for the stopped container
3. Identifies exit code and error message
4. Cross-references with your service configuration
5. Suggests fix: increase memory limit or fix application crash

---

### Why This Approach Works

**Deterministic Outputs:**
Specialized agents with real tooling produce consistent, reliable results. They don't hallucinate because they work with actual data—your logs, your configs, your infrastructure state.

**Production-Ready:**
Customers trust these agents for real troubleshooting because they behave like experienced DevOps engineers—methodical investigation, root cause analysis, specific fixes.

**Continuously Improving:**
As we add more specialized agents (Kubernetes Diagnostics, Database Performance, Security Scanner), the fleet becomes more capable without sacrificing accuracy.

---

### Roadmap (Coming Soon)

**Kubernetes Diagnostics Agent:**
- Pod crash loops and restarts
- Resource quota and limit issues
- Network policy debugging

**Database Performance Agent:**
- Slow query analysis
- Connection pool optimization
- Index recommendations

**Security Scanner Agent:**
- Infrastructure misconfigurations
- Compliance violations (HIPAA, SOC 2)
- Overly permissive IAM roles

---

## Section 9: Technical Credibility

### Section Title
**Built by DevOps Engineers, For Real-World Use**

### Subtitle
Not a theory. Not a prototype. A production platform born from 10+ years of solving infrastructure problems at scale.

---

### Founder Story

**Early Kubernetes Adopter**

2015-2016: Most companies were still on VMs. Kubernetes was 1 year old. Our founder deployed Kubernetes on bare metal VMware in a data center—before KOPS, before EKS, before AKS even existed.

**The Manual Years:**
- Custom cluster bootstrapping scripts
- Hand-rolled automation for deployments
- Every environment setup: a multi-day project
- Repeated the same infrastructure work across multiple startups

**Zillow Cloud Engineering**

2018: Joined Zillow's cloud engineering team working on **Zodiac**—an internal DevOps platform serving 2,000 engineers.

**The Realization:**
Enterprise teams get self-service ops platforms. Why don't small teams have this?

**The Question That Started Planton:**
"What if startups and consulting firms had the same self-service infrastructure that enterprises build internally?"

---

### Dogfooding: Planton Runs on Planton

**We Don't Ask You to Trust Something We Don't Use:**

Planton's production infrastructure is 100% managed through Planton itself. Zero exceptions.

- **Deployment target:** Google Cloud Platform (multi-region)
- **Orchestration:** All databases run on Kubernetes, deployed via Planton
- **Service Hub:** All backend services deployed through Planton pipelines
- **Zero manual deployments:** Everything through the platform or CLI

**What This Means:**
Every feature we ship, we use ourselves. Every bug we fix, we've likely hit in production. Every performance optimization, we've measured on our own infrastructure.

---

### Platform Architecture

**Production-Grade Components:**

**Control Plane:**
- GCP Cloud Run (multi-region for high availability)
- Horizontal auto-scaling based on load
- Zero-downtime deployments for platform updates

## Section 10: Security & Compliance

### Section Title
**Secure by Design, Compliance-Ready**

### Subtitle
Multiple security models, scoped permissions, and clear compliance roadmap—because trust is earned, not assumed.

---

### Deployment Runner Security Models

**You Choose Your Security Posture:**

Planton supports three deployment runner topologies. Start simple, upgrade to more secure models as your requirements grow.

---

#### Model 1: Basic - AWS Access Keys

**How It Works:**
Provide AWS access key and secret key. Planton-hosted runners use these credentials to deploy infrastructure in your account.

**Security:**
- Credentials encrypted at rest
- Stored in secure secrets management (Google Secret Manager)
- Never logged or exposed in UI
- Rotatable anytime via platform settings

**Best For:**
- Development environments
- Initial platform evaluation
- Non-production workloads

**Tradeoffs:**
- Long-lived credentials (rotation recommended)
- Highest trust in Planton (we hold the keys)

---

#### Model 2: Trust Relationship - AWS Assume Role

**How It Works:**
Configure cross-account trust policy in your AWS account. Planton platform assumes a role in your account with time-limited credentials.

**Security:**
- No long-lived credentials stored
- Temporary session tokens (auto-expire)
- Trust policy controls which Planton account can assume role
- Revocable instantly (delete trust relationship)

**Best For:**
- Production environments
- Compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC 2)
- Organizations with centralized AWS governance

**Setup:**
1. Create IAM role in your AWS account
2. Add trust policy allowing Planton's AWS account
3. Attach policies with scoped permissions (see below)
4. Provide role ARN to Planton platform

**Tradeoffs:**
- Requires AWS IAM configuration (5-10 minutes)
- Still requires trust in Planton platform

---

#### Model 3: Customer-Hosted Runner

**How It Works:**
Planton provides Docker image (`planton-deployer`). You deploy it as an ECS service in YOUR AWS account. Runner communicates back to Planton platform for job orchestration, but all infrastructure operations run within your boundary.

**Security:**
- Credentials never leave your AWS account
- You control IAM role attached to runner
- You control network egress/ingress
- Runner code auditable (Docker image layers inspectable)

**Best For:**
- Maximum security requirements
- Zero-trust environments
- Highly regulated industries (healthcare, finance)
- Air-gapped or restricted networks

**Setup:**
1. Pull `planton-deployer` Docker image from Planton registry
2. Deploy as ECS service in your AWS account
3. Attach IAM role with scoped permissions
4. Configure runner to communicate with Planton control plane
5. Platform detects runner and routes jobs to it

**Tradeoffs:**
- You manage runner infrastructure (minimal overhead, ~$10-20/month for ECS task)
- Requires networking configuration (if using VPC endpoints)

---

### Scoped Permissions: Least Privilege by Design

**No Blanket Admin Required:**

Planton never asks for `AdministratorAccess` or wildcard permissions. Every deployment component specifies exact IAM permissions needed.

**How It Works:**

**1. Audit the Terraform Code:**
All deployment components are open source in [Project Planton repository](https://github.com/project-planton/project-planton). Read the exact resources being created.

**2. Generate Scoped IAM Policy:**
Each component includes documented IAM permissions. Example for AWS ALB:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "elasticloadbalancing:CreateLoadBalancer",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
        "elasticloadbalancing:ModifyLoadBalancerAttributes",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DeleteLoadBalancer",
        "elasticloadbalancing:CreateListener",
        "elasticloadbalancing:CreateTargetGroup"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**3. Combine Permissions for Your Stack:**
Deploying Infra Chart with VPC + ALB + ECR? Combine IAM policies for each component.

**4. Attach to Runner:**
Whether using assume role or customer-hosted runner, attach the scoped policy.

**Why This Matters:**
- Security teams can audit exact permissions before granting access
- Principle of least privilege enforced at infrastructure level
- No risk of Planton platform over-reaching permissions

### Compliance Roadmap

Based on customer feedback (especially healthcare and fintech verticals), we're pursuing third-party certifications to enable regulated industry adoption.

---

#### SOC 2 Type I (Target: Q1 2026)

**What It Is:**
Third-party audit of security controls at a point in time. Validates that Planton has appropriate controls for data security, availability, and confidentiality.

**Why It Matters:**
Many enterprises require all vendors to be SOC 2 certified. Shifts conversation from "prove you're secure" to "here's our certification."

**Status:** Audit partner selected, control documentation in progress

---

#### HIPAA BAA (Target: Q2 2026)

**What It Is:**
Business Associate Agreement required for any vendor handling Protected Health Information (PHI) under HIPAA regulations.

**Why It Matters:**
Healthcare customers (like IOTA Technics) will require BAA to deploy production workloads handling patient data.

**Requirements:**
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging of all PHI access
- Access controls and authentication
- Breach notification procedures

**Status:** Architecture review in progress, compliance framework being codified

---

#### NIST CSF Standards

**What It Is:**
National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. Standardized security controls applicable across industries.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Base images pre-configured with NIST CSF standards
- Encryption levels standardized across cloud providers
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) enforced
- MFA requirements (biometric, token + password)

**Why It's Easier for Planton:**
Standards don't change frequently. We can codify them once in Terraform modules and apply consistently across all deployments.

---

#### MITRE ATT&CK Framework Integration

**What It Is:**
Threat detection framework mapping adversary tactics and techniques. Helps identify and mitigate security threats.

**Planned Integration:**
- Automated threat detection in deployment pipelines
- Security scanning of infrastructure configurations
- Alerting on known attack patterns
- Integration with Security Scanner Agent (Agent Fleet roadmap)

---

### Compliance as a Vertical Strategy

**Domain-Specific Rules:**
Following advisory feedback, we're building a rule-based engine for vertical-specific compliance:

- **Healthcare:** HIPAA + NIST CSF + state regulations
- **Fintech:** PCI DSS + SOC 2 + SOX compliance
- **Energy:** NERC CIP standards
- **Government:** FedRAMP requirements

**Why Rule-Based:**
Standards evolve. Rule engine allows us to update compliance requirements without code changes. Customers select their vertical, platform enforces appropriate controls.

**Pricing Model:**
Compliance features will be separate add-on tiers. Not every customer needs HIPAA (the bakery in Idaho doesn't care). Domain-specific compliance priced based on value delivered.

---

### Gradual Trust Model for Regulated Industries

**Start Non-Production:**
Deploy dev, QA, and staging environments first. Build trust through rigorous testing:
- Performance benchmarks
- Vulnerability scanning (static + dynamic)
- Security audits
- Compliance spot-checks

**Earn Production Access:**
Only after validation cycle, promote to production. Planton supports overlap period—run legacy and Planton-managed infrastructure in parallel during transition.
