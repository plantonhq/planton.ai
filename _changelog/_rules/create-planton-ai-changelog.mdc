# Rule: Create Planton.ai Changelog (action)

Purpose: When invoked, create a comprehensive changelog document in the `_changelog/` directory that captures the essence, context, and impact of recent work on the Planton.ai website. The changelog should be meaningful, well-structured, and appropriately sized based on the scope and impact of the change.

Usage: Invoke explicitly as `@create-planton-ai-changelog` after completing meaningful work in a conversation.

References: `@understand-cursor-rules`, existing changelogs in `_changelog/`

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Explicit Invocation Only

**DO NOT** create a changelog automatically or proactively. Changelogs must ONLY be created when the user explicitly invokes this rule with `@create-planton-ai-changelog`.

Never:
- ❌ Suggest creating a changelog without being asked
- ❌ Create a changelog at the end of a conversation automatically
- ❌ Assume the user wants a changelog created
- ❌ Create a changelog "to be helpful" without explicit request

Always:
- ✅ Wait for explicit `@create-planton-ai-changelog` invocation
- ✅ Confirm the request before creating the file
- ✅ Let the user decide when/if a changelog is needed

**This is a user-controlled action, not an automatic process.**

## When to Create a Changelog

Create a changelog when:
- ✅ You've completed a meaningful feature, refactoring, or improvement
- ✅ The work involved multiple components or pages
- ✅ The change introduces new UI patterns or design decisions
- ✅ The work took significant time/effort (typically 1+ hours)
- ✅ The change has notable impact on the website, users, or marketing goals
- ✅ You want to preserve the context and rationale for future reference
- ✅ New pages, features, or sections were added
- ✅ Content strategy or structure changed significantly
- ✅ Interactive features or demos were enhanced
- ✅ Performance or SEO improvements were implemented

**Skip changelogs for**:
- ✋ Trivial typo fixes or copy corrections
- ✋ Minor styling tweaks
- ✋ Work-in-progress or incomplete changes
- ✋ Changes already well-documented in PR descriptions
- ✋ Simple content updates without structural changes

## Sizing Guidance: Use Your Judgment

**Critical principle**: The changelog length should be **proportional to the feature's complexity and impact**, not artificially constrained or inflated.

### Small Changes (150-300 lines)
- Single page or component updates
- Focused bug fixes with clear before/after
- Minor UI improvements
- Configuration tweaks
- Simple content additions

**Example**: Navigation menu enhancement - straightforward problem, clear solution, limited scope

### Medium Changes (300-600 lines)
- Multi-page refactorings
- New UI patterns or components
- Documentation section rewrites
- Integration work across 2-3 features
- Interactive feature additions

**Example**: New solutions section - new pages, navigation updates, content structure

### Large Changes (600-1000+ lines)
- Major website redesigns
- Framework migrations
- Comprehensive feature rollouts across many pages
- Site-wide refactorings with broad impact
- New interactive experiences

**Example**: Complete website redesign, New documentation system, Interactive demo platform

**Golden rule**: If you're unsure, start shorter and add detail only where it adds real value. Quality over quantity.

## Changelog Structure

### File Naming
```
YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-brief-descriptive-slug.md
```

Examples:
- `2025-11-23-143022-solutions-pages-redesign.md`
- `2025-11-23-091545-interactive-demo-platform.md`
- `2025-11-22-164730-blog-system-with-mdx.md`

**IMPORTANT**: Get the actual current timestamp by running the command `date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"` and use that exact output as the prefix for the filename. Do NOT make up or guess the timestamp. Follow with a clear, kebab-case slug describing the change. The timestamp (HHMMSS) ensures automatic chronological sorting when multiple changelogs are created on the same day.

### Required Metadata

Every changelog should start with metadata in this format:

```markdown
# [Clear, Descriptive Title]

**Date**: [Month Day, Year]
**Type**: [Feature | Enhancement | Bug Fix | Refactoring | Content | Design]

---

**Status**: ✅ [Live | In Progress | Experimental]
**Timeline**: [Duration if relevant]
```

### Optional Sections (Include When Valuable)

Add these sections only when they provide meaningful value:

- **Breaking Changes**: When URLs, APIs, or integrations change
- **Migration Guide**: When content creators need to adapt
- **Visual Design**: Screenshots or design rationale
- **Content Strategy**: When content approach changes
- **Performance Metrics**: When performance is a key concern
- **SEO Impact**: For changes affecting search visibility
- **Known Limitations**: For incomplete implementations
- **Future Enhancements**: For planned follow-up work
- **A/B Testing Results**: When testing informed decisions
- **User Feedback**: When user input drove changes
- **Design Decisions**: When trade-offs were significant
- **Accessibility**: When accessibility was a focus
- **Analytics**: Impact on user behavior or conversions

## Writing Guidelines

### Do:
- ✅ **Start with context**: Why did this work happen?
- ✅ **Focus on value**: What problem does this solve for users/visitors?
- ✅ **Use concrete examples**: Show before/after screenshots, code snippets, URLs
- ✅ **Include numbers**: Metrics, timelines, page counts (when meaningful)
- ✅ **Explain decisions**: Why this approach vs alternatives?
- ✅ **Write for future you**: Capture the thinking, not just the what
- ✅ **Link to related work**: Connect the dots with other changes
- ✅ **Use formatting**: Screenshots, code blocks, tables, bullet lists for readability
- ✅ **Show visual changes**: Screenshots are especially valuable for UI work

### Don't:
- ❌ **Over-explain the obvious**: Assume the reader is technical
- ❌ **Include every detail**: Focus on what matters
- ❌ **Write generic summaries**: Be specific to Planton.ai
- ❌ **Skip the "why"**: Context is critical for future understanding
- ❌ **Ignore trade-offs**: Document decisions and their rationale
- ❌ **Use jargon without context**: Define terms that may be unclear

## Tone and Style

- **Informative, not promotional**: Focus on facts and impact (even though this is a marketing site)
- **Technical but accessible**: Balance depth with clarity
- **Professional but human**: You can say "we struggled with X" or "this was tricky"
- **Present tense for descriptions**: "The website now does X"
- **Past tense for actions**: "We implemented Y"

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a changelog:

- [ ] Title clearly describes the change
- [ ] Metadata includes Date, Type, and Components
- [ ] Summary captures essence in 2-4 sentences
- [ ] Problem statement explains why work was needed
- [ ] Solution section describes the approach
- [ ] Implementation details are technical but focused
- [ ] Benefits are concrete and measurable
- [ ] Screenshots included for visual changes
- [ ] Code examples (if any) are actual code, not pseudocode
- [ ] Related work connects this to other changes
- [ ] Length is proportional to scope and impact
- [ ] No sensitive information (credentials, internal URLs, etc.)
- [ ] File paths reference actual planton.ai structure

## Proportionality Examples

### ✅ Good: Appropriately Sized

**Small feature** (200 lines): 
- Problem: 1 paragraph
- Solution: 1-2 paragraphs + screenshots
- Benefits: 3-5 bullets
- Impact: 1 paragraph

**Medium feature** (500 lines):
- Problem: 2-3 paragraphs with pain points
- Solution: Component descriptions with screenshots
- Implementation: 3-4 key changes with code snippets
- Benefits: Categorized list with metrics
- Impact: User experience + SEO improvements

**Large feature** (900 lines):
- Problem: Comprehensive context with examples
- Solution: Full architecture with diagrams and phases
- Implementation: Detailed technical sections per component
- Benefits: Quantitative and qualitative analysis
- Visual Design: Before/after comparisons
- Impact: Multi-dimensional (users, conversion, SEO)

### ❌ Anti-patterns

- **Over-detailed small change**: 800-line changelog for a typo fix
- **Under-documented major change**: 150-line changelog for complete redesign
- **Kitchen sink**: Including every file touched, every line changed
- **Too abstract**: Generic descriptions without concrete examples or screenshots

## Planton.ai Specific Guidelines

### File Path Examples

When referencing code, use actual planton.ai paths:

```markdown
**File**: `src/app/solutions/[role]/page.tsx`
**File**: `src/components/features/InteractiveDemo.tsx`
**File**: `src/app/docs/[...slug]/page.tsx`
**File**: `public/docs/getting-started.md`
**File**: `content/media/images/feature-screenshot.png`
```

### URL Examples

Always reference actual website URLs:

```markdown
**Page**: https://planton.ai/solutions/by-role/devops-engineers
**Page**: https://planton.ai/features/planton-copilot
**Page**: https://planton.ai/docs/getting-started
**Demo**: https://planton.ai/demo
```

### Component Categories

Use these component categories consistently:

**Pages & Routes**:
- Landing Page, Solutions Pages, Features Pages, Pricing Page, Documentation, Blog System, Tour/Walkthrough

**Interactive Features**:
- Interactive Demo, Planton Copilot Interface, Resource Explorer, Kubernetes Dashboard

## Automation Notes

When creating the changelog:
1. **Get current timestamp**: Run `date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"` to get the actual current date and time for the filename
2. **Analyze the conversation**: Extract key decisions, changes, outcomes
3. **Assess scope**: Count files, pages, components affected
4. **Determine components**: Map changes to component categories
5. **Choose type**: Feature, Enhancement, Bug Fix, Refactoring, Content, Design
6. **Size appropriately**: Match detail level to impact
7. **Gather screenshots**: Include visual evidence for UI changes
8. **Write the file**: Create in `_changelog/YYYY-MM/` (year-month directory) with proper naming using the timestamp from step 1
9. **Confirm creation**: Provide file path and next steps

## Example Invocations

```
"We just completed the solutions pages redesign. @create-planton-ai-changelog"

"I've finished implementing the interactive demo platform with live API integration. 
@create-planton-ai-changelog - this was a major change"

"The documentation system migration is done. @create-planton-ai-changelog - 
include the MDX migration and new content structure"
```

## Remember

**Changelogs are living documentation** that helps future developers and content creators (including you) understand:
- What changed on the website
- Why it changed
- How it was implemented
- What the impact was on users and business goals

Write for the person who will need to understand this change in six months. Give them the context they need - no more, no less.

**When in doubt**: Start with the required sections, keep it focused, and add detail only where it truly helps understanding. A clear, concise 300-line changelog is better than a rambling 1000-line document.
