# Investor Deck v2: Mobile-Optimized YC-Style Redesign

**Date**: January 2, 2026
**Type**: Feature
**Components**: Investor Deck, UI Components, Design System, Navigation

## Summary

Redesigned the investor pitch deck at `/invest` with a mobile-first, YC-style approach featuring 13 slides (up from 10), shareable URLs via hash navigation, versioned routing (`/invest`, `/invest/v1`, `/invest/v2`), and updated content reflecting the December 2025 landing page positioning and customer traction. Each slide is optimized to fit within a single mobile viewport without scrolling.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

The initial investor deck (v1) received positive feedback but had a key usability issue: slides didn't fit within a single mobile screen, requiring scrolling and reducing the impact of the presentation. Additionally, the content needed updating to reflect the improved copywriting, customer stories, and competitive positioning developed during the December 2025 landing page optimization work.

### Pain Points

- **Mobile overflow**: Slides required scrolling on mobile devices, breaking the presentation flow
- **Outdated content**: Metrics and messaging didn't reflect latest customer traction (450+ deployments, 100% retention)
- **Missing competitive context**: No comparison slide showing Planton vs Terraform/Pulumi/Vercel
- **No customer stories**: Real customer names and metrics (Jai.CX, TynyBay, iorta TechNext) weren't featured
- **No shareable slides**: Couldn't link directly to specific slides like "The Ask"
- **No version history**: No way to access the original deck after updates

## Solution / What's New

Created a complete v2 investor deck with:

1. **Mobile-first design**: Every slide uses `100dvh` and responsive typography to fit single viewport
2. **13 slides** (vs 10 in v1): Added Comparison, Customers, and "Why Invest Now" slides
3. **Hash navigation**: URLs like `/invest/#ask` for sharing specific slides
4. **Version routing**: `/invest` serves v2, `/invest/v1` preserved for history
5. **Updated metrics**: 450+ deployments, 100% retention, $450+ MRR, 5 paying customers
6. **Real customer stories**: Jai.CX (<1hr deploy), TynyBay (8+ projects), iorta (96% savings)
7. **Competitive positioning**: Comparison table vs Terraform, Vercel

### Slide Structure

| # | Slide ID | Title | Key Content |
|---|----------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `cover` | Cover | Logo, tagline, key metrics (100% retention) |
| 2 | `problem` | Problem | 3 pain points (compact cards) |
| 3 | `solution` | Solution | InfraHub + ServiceHub (2-column) |
| 4 | `product` | How It Works | 3 steps visual |
| 5 | `comparison` | Why Planton | vs Terraform/Pulumi/Vercel (NEW) |
| 6 | `traction` | Traction | Updated metrics grid |
| 7 | `customers` | Customers | 3 customer stories (NEW) |
| 8 | `market` | Market | TAM/SAM numbers |
| 9 | `roadmap` | Roadmap | 4 phases horizontal timeline |
| 10 | `team` | Team | 5 members compact grid |
| 11 | `ask` | The Ask | $500K SAFE with collapsible explainer |

src/app/(micro-apps)/invest/
├── page.tsx                      # Serves v2 deck
├── v1/page.tsx                   # v1 route
└── v2/page.tsx                   # Explicit v2 route
```

### Hash Navigation

The orchestrator component handles URL hash for shareable slides:

```typescript
// Get initial slide from URL hash
function getInitialSlideIndex(): number {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return 0;
  const hash = window.location.hash.slice(1);
  if (hash) {
    const index = slideConfig.findIndex(s => s.id === hash);
    if (index !== -1) return index;
  }
  return 0;
}

// Update hash when navigating
const updateHash = useCallback((slideId: string) => {
  window.history.replaceState(null, '', `#${slideId}`);
}, []);
```

### Mobile-First CSS

Each slide uses viewport units and responsive typography:

```typescript
<div className="min-h-[100dvh] max-h-[100dvh] overflow-hidden">
  <motion.div className="w-full max-w-5xl mx-auto text-center">
    {children}
  </motion.div>
</div>

// Typography scaling
<h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-bold">
```

### Hybrid Design System

Combined landing-page-v2 colors with pitch deck drama:

```typescript
export const colors = {
  // Primary gradient (from landing-page-v2)
  gradientStart: '#7c3aed',  // Purple
  gradientEnd: '#0ea5e9',    // Blue
  accentGreen: '#10b981',
  
  // Pitch deck dark backgrounds
  bgPrimary: '#0a0a0f',
  bgSecondary: '#0f0f1a',
};
```

### Key Components Created
