# Changelog System Setup for Planton.ai

**Date**: November 23, 2025
**Type**: Feature
**Components**: Cursor Rules, Documentation Infrastructure, Development Workflow

## Summary

Established a comprehensive changelog creation system for the planton.ai repository by creating a dedicated cursor rule that enables systematic documentation of meaningful work. This follows the same pattern used across other Planton repos (planton-cloud, project-planton) and provides a consistent approach to capturing engineering context, decisions, and impact for future reference.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

The planton.ai repository lacked a structured way to document meaningful changes, improvements, and features added to the website. Without a changelog system:

### Pain Points

- **No historical context**: Difficult to understand why certain design or implementation decisions were made
- **Lost knowledge**: Important rationale and trade-offs not captured when making significant changes
- **Inconsistent documentation**: No standard format or location for documenting website evolution
- **Missing narrative**: Changes documented only in git commits and PR descriptions, lacking broader context
- **Team onboarding**: New contributors can't easily understand the evolution of the website
- **Future debugging**: When revisiting old code or content, context about "why" is missing

## Solution / What's New

Created a cursor rule (`@create-planton-ai-changelog`) that provides:

### Key Features

1. **Explicit Invocation Model**: Only creates changelogs when explicitly requested via `@create-planton-ai-changelog`
2. **Proportional Sizing**: Guidelines for 150-300 lines (small), 300-600 lines (medium), 600-1000+ lines (large) based on impact
3. **Structured Format**: Consistent sections including Summary, Problem Statement, Solution, Implementation Details, Benefits, Impact
4. **Website-Specific Context**: Tailored for Next.js marketing website needs with relevant components and examples
5. **Visual Documentation**: Emphasis on screenshots and visual evidence for UI changes
6. **Timestamp-Based Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-brief-descriptive-slug.md` for automatic chronological sorting

### Planton.ai Specific Customizations

The rule includes website-specific component categories:

**Pages & Routes**: Landing Page, Solutions Pages, Features Pages, Pricing Page, Documentation, Blog System, Tour/Walkthrough

**Interactive Features**: Interactive Demo, Planton Copilot Interface, Resource Explorer, Kubernetes Dashboard

**UI Components**: Navigation, Design System, UI Components, Layout Components

**Content & Media**: Content Management, Media Gallery, Video Players, Code Examples

**Infrastructure**: Build System, SEO/Performance, Analytics Integration, Deployment Pipeline

**Design & UX**: Visual Design, User Experience, Accessibility, Responsive Design

## Implementation Details

### Rule Structure

Created `~/scm/github.com/plantoncloud/planton.ai/.cursor/rules/create-planton-ai-changelog.mdc` with:

```markdown
---
description: Action rule to create a well-structured changelog document capturing meaningful work on Planton.ai website
globs: []
alwaysApply: false
---
```

### Directory Structure

Set up changelog organization:

```
planton.ai/
└── _changelog/
    └── YYYY-MM/          # Month-based directories
        └── YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-descriptive-slug.md
```

### Type Categories

Defined six types relevant to website work:
- **Feature**: New pages, sections, or capabilities
- **Enhancement**: Improvements to existing functionality
- **Bug Fix**: Corrections to broken behavior
- **Refactoring**: Code improvements without user-facing changes
- **Content**: Content updates, copy changes, documentation
- **Design**: Visual design updates, UI/UX improvements

### Optional Sections for Website Context

Added sections particularly valuable for website work:
- **Visual Design**: Screenshots and design rationale
- **Content Strategy**: When content approach changes
- **SEO Impact**: For changes affecting search visibility
- **A/B Testing Results**: When testing informed decisions
- **User Feedback**: When user input drove changes
- **Accessibility**: When accessibility was a focus
- **Analytics**: Impact on user behavior or conversions

### Consistency with Other Repos

Maintained the same core structure as planton-cloud and project-planton rules:
- Same explicit invocation philosophy (no automatic changelog creation)
- Same proportionality guidance and sizing examples
- Same quality checklist and writing guidelines
- Same file naming convention with timestamps
- Same metadata structure (Date, Type, Components, Summary)

## Benefits

### For Current Development

- **Context Preservation**: Rationale and decisions captured when fresh in mind
- **Design History**: Visual and UX decisions documented with screenshots
- **Content Evolution**: Track how messaging and content strategy evolves
- **Team Communication**: Share what changed and why across team members

### For Future Maintenance

- **Debugging Aid**: Understand why code or content was structured a certain way
- **Pattern Discovery**: Identify successful patterns across multiple changes
- **Onboarding Resource**: New team members can read chronological history
- **Decision Reference**: Look back at trade-offs and why alternatives were rejected

### For the Business

- **Marketing Evolution**: Track how positioning and messaging evolves
- **Feature Impact**: Document how new features affected user behavior
- **SEO History**: Understand SEO strategy decisions over time
- **Conversion Optimization**: Track A/B tests and optimization decisions

## Impact

### Immediate Impact

- planton.ai repository now has a standardized changelog system
- Developers can invoke `@create-planton-ai-changelog` after meaningful work
- Consistent with other Planton repos (planton-cloud, project-planton)

### Long-Term Impact

- **Knowledge Base**: Build up a searchable history of website evolution
- **Pattern Library**: Document successful approaches to common problems
- **Training Material**: Changelogs serve as case studies for best practices
- **Historical Record**: Preserve institutional knowledge as team evolves

### Developer Experience

- Clear process for documenting work
- No manual formatting or structure decisions needed
- Automatic timestamping ensures chronological order
- Examples and guidelines prevent analysis paralysis

## Related Work

This changelog system follows the pattern established in:

- `planton-cloud/.cursor/rules/product/create-planton-cloud-changelog.mdc` - Backend/monorepo changelog system
- `project-planton/.cursor/rules/create-project-planton-changelog.mdc` - CLI project changelog system

Future work will likely include similar rules for:
- `tekton-hub` repository (Tekton pipeline definitions)
- `infra-charts` repository (Helm chart library)

## Usage Example

After completing meaningful work on the website:

```
"We just completed the solutions pages redesign. @create-planton-ai-changelog"

"I've finished implementing the interactive demo platform. 
@create-planton-ai-changelog - this was a major change"

"The documentation system migration is done. @create-planton-ai-changelog"
```

The rule will:
1. Get current timestamp via `date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"`
2. Analyze the conversation to extract key changes
3. Assess scope and impact
4. Create appropriately-sized changelog
5. Save to `_changelog/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-slug.md`

## Testing

This changelog itself serves as the first test of the system:

- ✅ Rule invoked explicitly via `@create-planton-ai-changelog`
- ✅ Timestamp obtained from system: `2025-11-23-085726`
- ✅ File created in `_changelog/2025-11/` directory
- ✅ Follows the structure defined in the rule
- ✅ Sized proportionally to the change (small-medium at ~300 lines)
- ✅ Includes all required sections
- ✅ Uses website-specific component categories
- ✅ Written for future maintainers

## Known Limitations

None at this time. The rule is ready for production use.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:

1. **Changelog Index**: Auto-generate an index page listing all changelogs
2. **Tagging System**: Add tags or categories for easier filtering
3. **Related Changes**: Auto-link to related PRs, commits, or issues
4. **Template Validation**: Ensure all required sections are present
5. **Visual Integration**: Embed screenshots directly in changelogs
6. **Search Functionality**: Build a searchable changelog archive

---

**Status**: ✅ Production Ready
**Timeline**: ~1 hour to analyze existing rules, customize for planton.ai, and create the rule

*This changelog documents the creation of the changelog system itself - how meta! 🎯*
