# Copywriting Automation System for Planton.ai

**Date**: December 31, 2025  
**Type**: Feature  
**Components**: Content Management, Copywriting Workflow, Cursor Rules, Documentation

## Summary

Built a complete automation system for managing copywriting updates on planton.ai. The system provides a structured five-phase workflow from analyzing feedback materials to implementing approved content in React components, with HTML previews for stakeholder review and automatic build verification. Includes comprehensive cursor rule (~1,285 lines), four detailed READMEs (~2,000 lines total), and integration with existing git workflow rules.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

### The Copywriting Challenge

Planton.ai requires frequent content updates driven by:
- **Product repositioning**: As the platform evolves, messaging must reflect current capabilities
- **New features**: Platform updates need to be communicated on the website
- **Advisory feedback**: Strategic advisors provide positioning and messaging guidance
- **Competitive landscape**: Market changes require adjusted positioning
- **Customer feedback**: User insights drive content improvements

### Previous Workflow Pain Points

**Manual and Ad-hoc Process**:
- No structured workflow for handling feedback materials
- Feedback scattered across PDFs, transcripts, emails, notes
- Direct code changes without visual review stage
- Non-technical stakeholders couldn't easily review proposed copy
- No historical record of copywriting iterations and rationale
- Risk of breaking website with hasty content changes

**Inconsistent Outcomes**:
- Copy quality varied based on who was implementing
- Design system consistency not always maintained
- Component mapping decisions varied
- No clear guidelines for draft vs production-ready content

**Lost Context**:
- Why certain messaging decisions were made
- What feedback led to specific changes
- Historical evolution of positioning not captured
- Difficult to reference previous iterations

### Real-World Example

Recent landing page redesign (December 19, 2025):
- Advisory feedback meeting (Dec 13) → Materials scattered
- Multiple draft iterations (draft-1, draft-2, draft-3) created manually
- HTML previews generated ad-hoc for review
- No standardized process for feedback → implementation
- Manual component mapping to React files
- Implementation required deep knowledge of component structure

This experience highlighted the need for an automated, repeatable workflow.

## Solution / What's New

### Copywriting Automation System

A complete end-to-end system that automates the journey from feedback materials to production-ready React components, with built-in quality controls and stakeholder review stages.

### Core Components

**1. Cursor Rule: `update-planton-ai-copy-writing.mdc`**

Comprehensive action rule (~1,285 lines) that orchestrates the entire workflow:

- **Phase 1: Analysis**
  - Reads materials from workspace (PDFs, markdown, images, transcripts)
  - Extracts key insights and themes
  - Identifies target pages and sections
  - Summarizes findings for user confirmation

- **Phase 2: Staging**
  - Creates dated folder in `_stage-area/`
  - Generates structured markdown draft following writing guidelines
  - Creates styled HTML preview for visual review
  - Embeds HTML template (dark theme, professional typography)

- **Phase 3: Iteration**
  - Smart feedback handling (minor vs major changes)
  - Updates draft-1 for <50% changes
  - Creates draft-2+ for >50% changes or different approaches
  - Regenerates HTML previews automatically

- **Phase 4: Implementation**
  - Maps draft sections to React components
  - Updates or creates components in `src/`
  - Maintains design system consistency
  - Preserves TypeScript types and MUI patterns

- **Phase 5: Verification**
  - Runs `make build` to verify no errors
  - Generates changelog entry
  - Cleans workspace (removes materials)
  - Provides implementation summary

### Integration with Git Workflow

Works seamlessly with existing rules:
1. **Copywriting workflow**: `@update-planton-ai-copy-writing` (new)
2. **Create changelog**: `@create-planton-ai-changelog` (existing)
3. **Commit changes**: `@commit-planton-ai-changes` (existing)
4. **Generate PR info**: `@generate-planton-ai-pr-info` (enhanced with examples)

## Implementation Details

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Staged Drafts Before Code Changes**

**Decision**: Create markdown drafts + HTML previews in `_stage-area/` before touching source code.

**Rationale**:
- Allows stakeholder review without risking website stability
- Non-technical reviewers can assess messaging via HTML previews
- Provides historical record of iterations and decision-making
- Separates content creation from technical implementation

**2. Smart Iteration Detection**

**Decision**: Automatically determine whether to update draft-1 or create draft-2 based on feedback scope.

**Heuristics**:
- **Update draft-1**: <50% content change, same approach, minor edits
- **Create draft-2**: >50% content change, different approach, structural changes
- **Ask user**: When uncertain about scope

**Rationale**:
- Reduces cognitive load on user
- Maintains clean iteration history
- Allows comparison between approaches (draft-1 vs draft-2)

**3. Component Mapping Strategy**

**Decision**: Map draft sections to specific React components in `src/components/`.

**Mapping tables embedded in rule**:

| Draft Section | Component File |
|--------------|----------------|
| Hero | `src/components/landing-page-v2/HeroSection.tsx` |
| Problem/Solution | `src/components/landing-page-v2/ProblemSolution.tsx` |
| Infra Hub | `src/components/landing-page-v2/InfraHub.tsx` |
| Service Hub | `src/components/landing-page-v2/ServiceHub.tsx` |
| Customer Stories | `src/components/landing-page-v2/CustomerStories.tsx` |
| Pricing | `src/components/pricing/plans.tsx` |

**Rationale**:
- Provides clear guidance for implementation
- Maintains design system consistency
- Preserves TypeScript types and MUI patterns
- Reduces risk of breaking changes

**4. Workspace Cleanup After Implementation**

**Decision**: Automatically remove all files from `_workspace/` after successful implementation (except `.gitignore` and `README.md`).

**Rationale**:
- Prevents accidental git commits of sensitive materials
- Ensures clean slate for next iteration
- Avoids confusion about which materials are "current"
- Privacy - feedback materials don't end up in git history

**5. Git Tracking Strategy**

**Decision**:
- `_workspace/`: Gitignored (temporary materials)
- `_stage-area/`: Committed to git (historical record)

**Rationale**:
- Workspace contains raw feedback (potentially sensitive)
- Stage area contains refined drafts (valuable historical context)
- Future reference: "Why did we change this messaging?"
- Audit trail: Evolution of positioning over time

### Writing Guidelines Integration

Rule follows `@general-writing-guidelines.mdc` principles:

1. **Grounded in Truth**:
   - Content based on actual customer usage, real metrics
   - No speculation without evidence
   - Concrete examples from real customers

2. **Developer-Friendly**:
   - Technical accuracy with business benefits
   - Proper terminology without dumbing down
   - Analogies that clarify, not confuse

3. **Balanced Depth**:
   - Summary → progressive disclosure → details
   - Bullets and tables to compress information
   - Cut anything that doesn't add value

4. **Timeless**:
   - Explain concepts and systems
   - Avoid temporal language ("recently", "we just")
   - Focus on capabilities, not journey

5. **Context Before Details**:
   - What → Why → How → Details
   - Problem before solution
   - Outcome before implementation
