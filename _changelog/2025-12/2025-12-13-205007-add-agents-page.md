# Add Agents Page to Planton.ai Website

**Date**: December 13, 2025

## Summary

Added a comprehensive "Agents" page to the planton.ai public website at `/agents`. The page captures the evolutionary journey from a single copilot concept to a microagent system, showcasing the Agent Fleet vision with 8 distinct sections covering the problem statement, technology stack (Graphton framework), agent showcase, real-world scenarios, and future vision.

## Problem Statement

Planton Cloud's Agent Fleet represents a significant evolution in DevOps automation—moving from a single generalist AI copilot to specialized microagents. This story needed a dedicated landing page to:

### Pain Points

- No public-facing page explaining the Agent Fleet vision and capabilities
- Potential customers couldn't understand what differentiates Planton's approach from generic AI assistants
- The journey from single copilot to microagents wasn't documented for marketing
- The Graphton framework (enabling 3-10 lines of code for production agents) had no visibility

## Solution

Created a full-featured landing page with 8 modular sections, following the existing planton.ai design system (Material UI + Tailwind CSS). The page tells a compelling story while providing technical depth.

### Page Architecture

```
/agents
├── HeroSection       - "Cursor for DevOps" headline with animated agent constellation
├── JourneyTimeline   - 6-phase evolution from single copilot to autonomous vision
├── ProblemSolution   - Side-by-side comparison of traditional DevOps vs Agent Fleet
├── TechnologySection - Cursor analogy + Graphton framework code showcase
├── AgentShowcase     - 6 flagship agents with capabilities
├── RealScenarios     - 3 before/after scenarios with time savings
├── VisionSection     - Context-aware, autonomous, and expandable fleet vision
└── CTASection        - Call-to-action with stats and links
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

**Page Route:**
- `src/app/(root)/agents/page.tsx` - Next.js page with metadata and SEO

**Components (8 files in `src/components/agents/`):**
- `hero-section.tsx` - CSS-based animated agent constellation (no images/emojis)
- `journey-timeline.tsx` - 6-phase cards with gradient backgrounds
- `problem-solution.tsx` - Red/green comparison cards
- `technology-section.tsx` - Terminal-style code block with syntax highlighting
- `agent-showcase.tsx` - 6 agent cards with hover effects
- `real-scenarios.tsx` - Before/after scenarios with step breakdowns
- `vision-section.tsx` - 3 vision cards (context-aware, autonomous, expandable)
- `cta-section.tsx` - Gradient CTA with stats bar
- `index.ts` - Barrel export

### Key Design Decisions

1. **CSS-based visuals over SVG images**: The hero section uses CSS animations and gradients for the agent constellation, avoiding emoji rendering issues and providing smooth hover interactions.

2. **Route groups**: Used Next.js `(root)` route group pattern to match existing site structure.

3. **Component imports**: Uses `@/components/landing-page` for shared components (`PageSection`, `SectionContainer`, `Pill`, `SectionTitle`).

4. **Text-based icons**: Agent nodes use single letters (P, A, K, D, S, etc.) instead of emojis for cross-browser reliability.

### Repository Context

The work targeted `plantoncloud/planton.ai` (the public website repo), distinct from `plantoncloud-inc/planton.ai` which caused initial confusion due to similar naming.

## Benefits

### For Marketing
- Clear narrative explaining Agent Fleet's value proposition
- "Cursor for DevOps" positioning resonates with developers
- Before/after scenarios provide concrete proof of value

### For Technical Credibility
- Graphton framework code example shows simplicity (3-10 lines)
- 6 real agent types demonstrate breadth of coverage
- Future vision section shows roadmap ambition

### For SEO
- Full metadata with OpenGraph and Twitter cards
- Keyword-rich content (DevOps AI, AI agents, infrastructure automation)
- Clean URL at `/agents`

## Impact

### Who's Affected
- **Visitors**: New landing page available at `/agents`
- **Marketing**: Can share dedicated URL for Agent Fleet
- **Sales**: Demo booking link integrated in CTA

### Metrics
- 8 React components created (~70KB total)
- 1 new route added
- 0 external image dependencies (all CSS-based visuals)
