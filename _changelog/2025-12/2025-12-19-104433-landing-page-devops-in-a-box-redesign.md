# Landing Page Redesign: DevOps-in-a-Box Positioning

**Date**: December 19, 2025  
**Type**: Feature | Design  
**Components**: Landing Page, Design System, UI Components

## Summary

Complete redesign of the planton.ai landing page to reflect the updated "DevOps-in-a-Box" product positioning. The new landing page replaces the previous copilot-focused messaging with a comprehensive presentation of Planton as a multi-cloud automation platform that eliminates DevOps bottlenecks. Built 12 new sections with a modern dark theme, gradient effects, and interactive visual elements.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

Following the December 13, 2025 advisory feedback session with Ruchi and strategic advisors, the team decided to update the product positioning. The previous landing page was built around the "Planton Copilot" concept which had been pivoted away from after 8 months of experimentation. The product is now positioned as a comprehensive DevOps platform with three core pillars:

1. **Infra Hub** - Infrastructure deployment automation
2. **Service Hub** - Backend CI/CD (Vercel for backend)
3. **Agent Fleet** - Specialized AI agents for DevOps tasks

### Pain Points

- Previous landing page messaging didn't reflect current product capabilities
- Copilot positioning was no longer accurate after the pivot to specialized agents
- Missing sections for key features (Service Hub, Open Standards, Security & Compliance)
- No customer proof points or case studies featured
- Outdated competitive positioning

## Solution / What's New

Created a completely new landing page component system (`landing-page-v2`) with 12 comprehensive sections that tell the Planton story from problem to solution:

### 1. Hero Section
- Headline: "DevOps-in-a-Box—From Code to Cloud in Under an Hour"
- Social proof badge with customer retention stats
- Mock dashboard preview showing Infra Hub and Service Hub
- Trust indicators (Multi-Cloud, Open Source, Zero Vendor Lock-In)

### 2. Problem/Solution Section
Three-column layout targeting key audiences:
- **IT Consulting Firms**: Environment deployment <1 hour vs weeks
- **Startups**: $20/dev/month vs $150K+/year for DevOps engineer
- **Established Teams**: 100% visibility into infrastructure changes

### 3. Infra Hub Section
- Zero-config CI/CD with live Terraform visualization mock
- Infra Charts explanation (DAG orchestration)
- Deployment Component Store by cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Customer proof point: iorta TechNext

### 4. Service Hub Section
- "Vercel for Backend—In YOUR Cloud" positioning
- No More vs You Get comparison
- Multi-cloud target support (ECS, EKS, Cloud Run, etc.)
- Pipeline flow visualization
- Customer quote from Tynybay

### 5. Open Standards Section (NEW)
- GitHub & GitLab native integration

- Tekton-powered CI/CD transparency (CNCF graduated project)
- Vendor lock-in comparison

### 6. Open Source Foundation Section
- Project Planton repository transparency
- Built-in exit strategy (4-step process)
- "Use Planton because it accelerates your team—not because you're locked in"

### 7. Agent Fleet Section

- Pivot to specialized agents explanation
- Current agents: Pipeline Manager, ECS Troubleshooter (Beta)
- Roadmap for future agents

### 8. Customer Stories Section

- **iorta TechNext → SalesVerse**: AWS ECS, 7 developers, $450/month
- Before/After comparisons with economics breakdown

### 9. Pricing Section (Simplified)
- $20/dev/month + $0.006/minute model
- Real customer example with 96% cost reduction
- Link to detailed pricing page

### 10. Built by DevOps Engineers Section
- Dogfooding: Planton runs on Planton
- 24/7 support capability
- Engineering philosophy cards

### 11. Security & Compliance Section
- Three deployment runner security models (Basic, Trust Relationship, Customer-Hosted)

## Implementation Details

### New Component Architecture

Created `/src/components/landing-page-v2/` with:

```
landing-page-v2/
├── index.ts              # Exports all components
├── shared.tsx            # Design system (colors, Section, Typography, Buttons, Cards, Badges, Icons)
├── HeroSection.tsx       # Hero with animated mock dashboard
├── ProblemSolution.tsx   # Three-column target audience cards
├── InfraHub.tsx          # Infrastructure features
├── ServiceHub.tsx        # CI/CD features
├── OpenStandards.tsx     # GitHub, Terraform, Pulumi, Tekton

├── BuiltByDevOps.tsx     # Company/team section
├── SecurityCompliance.tsx # Security models & compliance
└── FinalCTA.tsx          # Final call-to-action
```

### Design System

Created a consistent design system in `shared.tsx`:

**Colors:**
- Primary gradient: `#7c3aed` (purple) to `#0ea5e9` (blue)

- Background: `#0a0a0a` with gradient variants
- Text: White primary, `#a0a0a0` secondary, `#666` muted

**Components:**
- `Section` - Wrapper with variant support (default, dark, gradient)
- `SectionTitle`, `SectionSubtitle`, `FeatureTitle`, `BodyText` - Typography hierarchy
- `PrimaryButton`, `SecondaryButton` - Gradient and outlined styles
- `Card` - With hover effects and gradient variants
- `Badge` - Multiple variants (default, success, warning, purple)
- `Grid` - Responsive column layouts
- `Quote` - Testimonial display
- `Metric` - Large number displays

### Link Updates

All CTAs properly linked:
- **Start Free Trial** → `https://console.planton.ai/`
- **Book Demo / Watch Demo** → Google Forms demo request
- **Request Early Access** → Google Forms demo request
- **Pricing** → `/pricing` (internal)
- **GitHub links** → `https://github.com/plantonhq/project-planton`

### Files Modified

```
src/app/(root)/page.tsx          # Updated to use new components
src/components/index.ts          # Added landing-page-v2 export
```
