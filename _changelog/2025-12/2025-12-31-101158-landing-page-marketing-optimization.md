# Landing Page Marketing Optimization Implementation

**Date**: December 31, 2025  
**Type**: Feature  
**Components**: Landing Page, UI Components, Design System

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive landing page marketing optimization based on competitive analysis feedback. Added 6 new components (SecurityTrustBar, SocialProofBar, HowItWorks, ComparisonTable, WallOfLove, ROICalculator) and enhanced 9 existing components to close the gap between Planton's product capabilities and marketing execution.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

The landing page, while technically accurate, wasn't effectively communicating Planton's value proposition compared to competitors. A competitive analysis revealed that while Planton has a "genuinely superior product," the marketing execution wasn't matching the product quality.

### Pain Points

- Hero section lacked quantified social proof (specific metrics, customer counts)
- No direct competitive comparison to help visitors understand positioning
- Missing visual "How It Works" flow for quick understanding
- Testimonials were sparse and not prominently featured
- No interactive ROI calculator to demonstrate cost savings
- Trust signals (compliance, security) weren't visible enough
- CTAs were unclear with competing options

## Solution / What's New

### Page Route Restructure (`src/app/(root)/page.tsx`)
