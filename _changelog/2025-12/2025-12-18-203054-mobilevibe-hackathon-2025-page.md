# MobileVibe Hackathon 2025 - Event Page Launch

**Date**: December 18, 2025  
**Type**: Feature  
**Components**: Landing Page, UI Components, Content Management

## Summary

Created a comprehensive hackathon event page at `/hackathon/mobile-vibe-2025` for Planton Cloud's first mobile app hackathon. The page includes a full event experience with hero section, event details, goals explanation, app ideas showcase, participation guide, and FAQ. Additionally created Slack announcement templates for team communication.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

Planton Cloud has never built mobile apps, and the workflow for mobile development is not established. To normalize mobile app building and enable quick prototyping of small ideas, we needed to organize a hackathon where the team could learn together and establish these workflows collaboratively.

### Pain Points

- No mobile app development workflow exists at Planton Cloud
- Small app ideas remain unbuilt due to lack of mobile development experience
- Team members have specific needs (vehicle mileage tracker, construction expense tracker) that could be solved with simple mobile apps
- Need a way to announce and organize the event effectively

## Solution / What's New

Built a dedicated hackathon event page with modern, engaging design matching the planton.ai aesthetic. The page serves as both an announcement platform and a comprehensive information hub for the event.

### Key Features

**1. Event Page** (`/hackathon/mobile-vibe-2025`)
- **Hero Section**: Eye-catching purple/pink gradient theme with mobile phone illustrations, event date/time badge
- **Event Details**: Four-card layout covering when, format, RSVP, and prerequisites
- **Goals Section**: Explains why this hackathon matters and what we want to achieve
- **App Ideas**: Showcases two initial app ideas with detailed features
- **Participation CTA**: Simple 3-step process to join the hackathon
- **FAQ Section**: 9 common questions answered comprehensively

**2. Slack Announcements**
- Full version: Comprehensive announcement with all details
- Short version: Concise version for quick reading
- Both include website link, event details, and app ideas

### Visual Design

The page uses a purple-to-pink gradient theme to match the "MobileVibe" branding:
- Purple (#a855f7) and pink (#ec4899) gradients throughout
- Mobile phone device illustrations in the hero
- Glassmorphism cards with backdrop blur
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Fully responsive design

```

### Component Architecture

All components follow the existing planton.ai patterns:
- Use Material-UI components (`Box`, `Typography`, `Stack`)
- Leverage shared layout components (`PageSection`, `SectionContainer`)
- Client-side rendering with `'use client'` directive
- Responsive Tailwind classes for layout

### Initial App Ideas

**1. Vehicle Mileage Tracker** (for Avinash)
- Track odometer readings over time
- Automatic mileage calculation
- Historical trend visualization
- Simple data entry interface

**2. Construction Partner Expense Tracker** (for Sai)
- Track partner investments during real estate construction projects
- Record expenses by partner with receipts/notes
- Real-time investment totals per partner
- Calculate profit distribution at project completion
- Replace paper-based expense reconciliation

### Event Details

- **Date**: Monday, December 22, 2025
- **Time**: 9:00 AM (full day, 8-10 hours)
- **Format**: Hybrid (in-person at office + remote)
- **RSVP**: Informal - just show up
- **Prerequisites**: None - development environments will be set up together

### Technical Implementation

**Metadata & SEO**:
```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'MobileVibe Hackathon 2025 | Planton Cloud',
  description: 'Join Planton Cloud\'s first-ever mobile app hackathon...',
  keywords: 'mobile app hackathon, mobile development, Android, iOS...',
  openGraph: { ... },
  twitter: { ... }
};
```

**Component Pattern**:
```typescript
export const HeroSection = () => {
  return (
    <PageSection>
      <PageSectionBackgroundContainer>
        {/* Gradient glows */}
      </PageSectionBackgroundContainer>
      <SectionContainer>
        {/* Content */}
      </SectionContainer>
    </PageSection>
  );
};
```

**Styling Approach**:
- Tailwind utility classes for layout and spacing
- Material-UI `sx` prop for gradients and complex styles
- Custom CSS classes for animations
- Responsive breakpoints (`md:`, `lg:`)

### Key Design Decisions

**Purple/Pink Theme**: Chosen to differentiate from the typical blue theme used elsewhere on planton.ai, creating a distinct identity for the hackathon while maintaining brand consistency.

**Mobile Phone Illustrations**: Used stylized mobile device graphics in the hero to immediately communicate the hackathon's focus on mobile app development.

**Information Architecture**: Structured the page to answer questions progressively:
1. What is this? (Hero)
2. When and how? (Event Details)
3. Why should I care? (Goals)
4. What will we build? (App Ideas)
5. How do I join? (Participation CTA)
6. What if I have questions? (FAQ)

**Informal Tone**: Maintained an approachable, team-focused tone throughout the content to encourage participation and reduce barriers to entry.

## Benefits
