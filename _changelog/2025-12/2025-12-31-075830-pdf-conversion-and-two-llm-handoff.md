# PDF Conversion and Two-LLM Handoff Workflow

**Date**: December 31, 2025  
**Type**: Enhancement  
**Components**: Copywriting Workflow, PDF Conversion, Content Management, Architecture

## Summary

Enhanced the copywriting automation system with two critical features: automatic PDF to Markdown conversion for feedback materials, and a two-LLM handoff architecture that separates content creation from code implementation. These changes eliminate manual PDF processing and enable specialized LLMs to handle their areas of expertise through self-contained handoff documents.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

### PDF Processing Bottleneck

**Problem**: Advisory feedback, meeting notes, and research documents often arrive as PDF files. The AI cannot directly read PDFs, requiring manual conversion before using the copywriting automation workflow.

**Real-World Example**:
- Advisory feedback received as `2025-12-24.planton.ai-website-comments.pdf`
- Had to manually research PDF to Markdown conversion tools
- Consulted ChatGPT for command-line conversion methods
- Tested multiple approaches (`pandoc`, `pdftotext`, `marker`)
- Eventually used `pdftotext | pandoc` pipeline successfully
- Process took 30+ minutes of experimentation

**Pain Points**:
- Manual conversion required technical knowledge
- Broke workflow momentum (research → install → test → convert)
- Different file formats required different tools
- No consistent, automated approach
- Error-prone (scanned PDFs, encrypted PDFs, complex layouts)

### Single-LLM Limitations

**Problem**: Using one LLM for both copywriting and React implementation created suboptimal results.

**Copywriting LLM Challenges**:
- Had to understand React component structure
- Needed to know TypeScript types and MUI patterns
- Focused on code details instead of content quality
- Implementation knowledge cluttered copywriting process

**Implementation LLM Challenges**:
- Had to parse copywriting conversation history
- Needed context about why messaging decisions were made
- Risk of misunderstanding approved content
- No clear handoff point

**Strategic Issue**: Different LLMs excel at different tasks. A copywriting-specialized LLM shouldn't need to understand React internals, and a code-focused LLM shouldn't need to understand the copywriting iteration process.

## Solution / What's New

### 1. Automatic PDF to Markdown Conversion

**Tool**: `content/copywriting/_rules/pdf_converter/convert_pdf.py`

Python script that:
- Checks for required dependencies (Poppler, Pandoc)
- Shows formatted installation instructions if missing
- Finds all PDF files in `_workspace/`
- Converts each PDF using `pdftotext | pandoc` pipeline
- Outputs `.md` files with same name in same location
- Preserves original PDFs for reference
- Provides detailed terminal output with status indicators

**Conversion Pipeline**:
```
PDF → pdftotext (text extraction) → pandoc (markdown conversion) → .md file
```

**Integration**: The cursor rule automatically runs the converter at the start of Phase 1 (Analysis) when PDFs are detected.

### 2. Two-LLM Handoff Architecture

**Architectural Change**: Split workflow into two specialized phases handled by different LLMs.

**Phase Split**:

**Copywriting LLM** (Phases 1-4):
1. PDF conversion (automatic)
2. Analysis of materials
3. Staging and iteration (drafts + HTML previews)
4. **Handoff document creation** (new)

**Implementation LLM** (Phases 5-6, separate session):
5. Component implementation (reads handoff.md)
6. Verification and cleanup

**Handoff Document**: `handoff.md` created automatically when draft is approved

**Self-Contained Contents**:
- Overview and objective
- Complete context (why this change matters)
- Full approved content from all draft sections
- Component mapping table (files to update)
- Detailed implementation instructions
- Design system reference
- Verification checklist
- Pre-written changelog template
- Reference materials list

**Key Innovation**: Implementation LLM receives ONLY the handoff document - no access to copywriting conversation history. Everything needed is in one file.

## Implementation Details

### PDF Converter Tool

**File**: `content/copywriting/_rules/pdf_converter/convert_pdf.py`

**Core Functions**:

1. **Dependency Checking**:
```python
def check_dependencies() -> Tuple[bool, List[str]]:
    """Check if pdftotext and pandoc are installed."""
    missing = []
    if not shutil.which('pdftotext'):
        missing.append('pdftotext (from Poppler)')
    if not shutil.which('pandoc'):
        missing.append('pandoc')
    return (len(missing) == 0, missing)
```

2. **PDF Conversion**:
```python
def convert_pdf_to_markdown(pdf_path: Path, output_path: Path) -> bool:
    """Convert PDF using pdftotext | pandoc pipeline."""
    # Extract text
    pdftotext_result = subprocess.run(['pdftotext', str(pdf_path), '-'], ...)
    # Convert to markdown
    pandoc_result = subprocess.run(['pandoc', '-t', 'markdown', '--wrap=none'], ...)
    # Write output
    output_path.write_text(pandoc_result.stdout)
```

3. **Batch Processing**:
```python
def find_pdf_files(workspace_dir: Path) -> List[Path]:
    """Find all PDFs in workspace."""
    return list(workspace_dir.glob('*.pdf'))
```

**Terminal UX**: Formatted output with emojis, status indicators, progress reporting

**Error Handling**: Graceful failures with helpful error messages

### Cursor Rule Updates

**File**: `content/copywriting/_rules/update-planton-ai-copy-writing.mdc`

**Key Changes**:

1. **Added PDF Conversion Step** (Start of Phase 1):
```markdown
### PDF Conversion (Automatic)

**Before analyzing workspace content, check for PDF files and convert them to Markdown.**

1. Check for PDF files in _workspace/
2. If PDFs exist, run: python3 content/copywriting/_rules/pdf_converter/convert_pdf.py
3. Verify conversion succeeded
4. Proceed with analysis using generated Markdown files
```

2. **Replaced Phase 4** (Implementation → Handoff):
```markdown
## Phase 4: Handoff Document Generation

### Two-LLM Workflow

**Important**: This copywriting workflow uses a two-LLM approach:
1. LLM 1 (Copywriting): Content creation, iteration, approval (Phases 1-3)
2. LLM 2 (Implementation): React component updates, build verification (separate session)

### Generating the Handoff Document

When user approves draft, automatically create handoff.md with:
- Complete implementation context
- Full approved content
- Component mapping
- Detailed instructions
- Verification checklist
```

3. **Updated Workflow Diagrams**: Two separate mermaid diagrams (Copywriting LLM vs Implementation LLM)

4. **Added Handoff Template**: Complete structure for `handoff.md` (~200 lines)

## Design Decisions

### Why pdftotext + pandoc (Not marker or pdfplumber)?

**Decision**: Use `pdftotext | pandoc` pipeline

**Alternatives Considered**:
- `marker`: AI-powered, excellent output quality but slower and requires pip
- `pdfplumber`: Python library with fine control but requires custom scripts
- `pandoc` alone: Cannot read PDFs directly (only writes to PDF)
- `ocrmypdf`: For scanned PDFs only

**Rationale**:
1. **Reliability**: `pdftotext` is battle-tested, predictable
2. **Speed**: Fast text extraction (2-5 seconds per PDF)
3. **Dependencies**: Homebrew packages (easy installation)
4. **Simplicity**: Two-command pipeline, no custom logic
5. **Quality**: Pandoc produces clean Markdown for most documents

**Trade-off**: May need manual cleanup for complex layouts, but this is acceptable for advisory feedback and meeting notes (mostly text).

### Why Separate Handoff Document (Not Direct Implementation)?

**Decision**: Create `handoff.md` as bridge between LLMs

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single LLM for everything: Less specialized, lower quality
- Pass conversation history to implementation LLM: Context overload, harder to parse
- Recreate context in implementation phase: Wastes time, risks errors

**Rationale**:
1. **Specialization**: Each LLM excels at its phase
2. **Clean Context**: Implementation LLM gets only what it needs
3. **Auditability**: handoff.md documents approved content
4. **Flexibility**: User controls when to switch LLMs
5. **Reusability**: handoff.md can be re-executed if implementation fails

**Example**: If implementation fails (build errors), user can retry with same handoff.md in new implementation LLM session without re-running copywriting phase.

### Why Preserve Original PDFs?

**Decision**: Keep PDFs after converting to Markdown

**Rationale**:
- Reference for accuracy checking
- Some PDFs have annotations or visual elements
- Rollback if Markdown conversion is incorrect
- Audit trail for feedback sources

**Alternative**: Could delete PDFs after conversion to save space, but reference value outweighs storage cost.

## Known Limitations

### PDF Conversion

**Not Supported**:
- Scanned PDFs without OCR (shows warning, manual OCR needed)
- Encrypted/password-protected PDFs
- PDFs with complex multi-column layouts (may need manual cleanup)
- Image extraction (images noted but not converted)

**Workaround for Scanned PDFs**:
```bash
brew install ocrmypdf
ocrmypdf input.pdf output.pdf
# Then run convert_pdf.py
```

### Handoff Document

**Limitations**:
- Implementation LLM must follow instructions accurately
- No automatic verification that implementation matches handoff
- User must manually verify implementation correctness

**Mitigation**:
- Detailed instructions in handoff.md
- Verification checklist included
- Pre-written changelog for consistency
- Build verification catches technical errors

## Future Enhancements

### PDF Conversion

**Short-Term**:
- [ ] Support for OCR (automatic scanned PDF detection)
- [ ] Image extraction and embedding
- [ ] Table formatting preservation
- [ ] Multi-column layout handling

**Medium-Term**:
- [ ] Alternative tools (marker integration for higher quality)
- [ ] Custom buildpack for specialized PDFs
- [ ] PDF preview in HTML (side-by-side comparison)

### Handoff Workflow

**Short-Term**:
- [ ] Handoff document validation (ensure completeness)
- [ ] Implementation verification (compare handoff vs actual changes)
- [ ] Handoff template customization (different page types)

**Medium-Term**:
- [ ] Automated testing after implementation (visual regression)
- [ ] Handoff document versioning (if implementation needs retry)
- [ ] Integration with issue tracking (link handoff to GitHub issues)

**Long-Term**:
- [ ] Three-LLM workflow (Copywriting → Review → Implementation)
- [ ] Automated rollback if implementation fails
- [ ] A/B testing integration (create variants from single handoff)

## Testing

### PDF Converter Testing

**Manual Test Performed**:
```bash
# Real PDF from workspace
python3 content/copywriting/_rules/pdf_converter/convert_pdf.py

# Result: ✅ Success
# Input:  2025-12-24.planton.ai-website-comments.pdf (8KB)
# Output: 2025-12-24.planton.ai-website-comments.md (25KB)
```

**Verified**:
- ✅ Dependency checking works
- ✅ PDF text extraction successful
- ✅ Markdown conversion clean
- ✅ Terminal output formatted correctly
- ✅ Error handling (tested missing dependencies simulation)

### Two-LLM Workflow Testing

**Tested Scenarios**:
- ✅ Handoff document template structure complete
- ✅ All required sections present
- ✅ Component mapping tables accurate
- ✅ Documentation updated across all READMEs
- ✅ Mermaid diagrams render correctly
- ✅ No circular references or ambiguities

**Not Yet Tested** (Pending real usage):
- Implementation LLM executing from handoff.md
- Complete end-to-end workflow with LLM switch
- Handoff document completeness for complex changes

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Workflows

**No Breaking Changes**: The two-LLM workflow is additive. If you want to use a single LLM, you can still manually implement after draft approval.

**Migration Path**:
1. Use copywriting LLM as before (triggers rule)
2. When draft approved, handoff.md is created
3. **New step**: Switch to implementation LLM with handoff.md
4. Rest of workflow remains the same

**Backward Compatibility**: Old stage folders (without handoff.md) still work. Handoff is only created for new iterations.

### Installing Dependencies

**One-time setup for PDF conversion**:
```bash
brew install poppler pandoc

# Verify installation
which pdftotext  # Should show path
which pandoc     # Should show path

# Test conversion
python3 content/copywriting/_rules/pdf_converter/convert_pdf.py
```

### Handoff Document

**Information Flow**:
- Copywriting LLM → handoff.md → Implementation LLM
- No sensitive credentials in handoff (content only)
- All implementation details are public (open source)

**Access Control**:
- Handoff.md committed to git (readable by team)
- No secrets or API keys included
- Content is public-facing website copy
